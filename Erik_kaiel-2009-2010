‘The performing body as Luther’s printing press: holy, heretical, heterodox. Killing us softly with its song.’

‘The director is a midwife, sharing wisdom and experience; giving context, proposing a mode of discourse. Call her Ishmael.’

‘Every performance centres around the observer. Not simply to watch, but to make sense of it.’

‘Performance offers no answers, but it deepens the questions.’ 

## Rhinoceros Reigns: Grotowski in Wolof

[intro]
‘The beauty of open-ended inquiry as opposed to pre-production research is that it keeps resurfacing in unexpected moments.’ Teaching a workshop in West Africa in May 2010, choreographer Erik Kaiel found himself building further upon the Danslab research he did in February of this same year. ‘Inshallah.’ 

Erik Kaiel

Nagadef. Relentless sun, bleating goats, mantras from the mosques. In shade wreathed in birdsong I sit to write. A paradoxical peace, as these intricate rhythms interlace. I am now in Saint Louis, Senegal’s colonial capital. Two flights and a winding road have brought me here. Dusty towns, Baobab forests, and scrub brush deserts give way to a litany of white buses passing through. Al-Hamdulilla-Hi painted across the front of each as a spiritual front bumper good luck charm. I find myself in a nation of black cranes, long, elegant, gracious, graceful, demure. Even the taxi drivers have the patience of saints. 
I have come to teach, to offer contemporary forms to young dancers brought up on hip-hop and traditional Senegalese dance. Somehow, between tribal elders and MTV, I need to carve out a third space; not another fixed form, but an openness for each individual voice. Private language in public space. The performing body as Luther’s printing press: holy, heretical, heterodox. Killing us softly with its song. I am encouraging each performer to forge an alloy of indigenous forms, Western practice, and personal approach. False lions and carnivorous lambs. A discipline without disciples. Al-Hamdulilla-Hi. Bedouin intent. Cacophonic order. Paradoxical peace. Beauty is the road self-chosen, not blindly followed. 

### Utopia
For some, form follows function. For me, intent is the content. Satyagraha as the Holy Grail. The rest are overtones. The performer commits their entire being to their intention. Submission to the will of the action. Through this they are fully alive. They model an intensity of being unsustainable in everyday life. When asked why he wrote poetry, Pessoa responded: ‘Because life is not enough’. The performer does the same. 
I share this priority of absolute commitment with Grotowski, but my liberation theology goes a step further. That commitment must not be towards the intent of the director, but to the performer’s own intent. ‘Do it like you mean it.’ The unintended gesture has no worth. The unlived life is not worth examining. 
To achieve this, both producer and director must sacrifice their authority -including the myth of individual authorship- to the practitioners. The director is a midwife, sharing wisdom and experience; giving context, proposing a mode of discourse. Call her Ishmael. On the beach, helping to launch a living theatre, where performance is not a fixed form, but a shared understanding between performers; a constantly-adapting organism; an elusive utopian whale. 
To achieve this goal, every performer must build their technical skills and heighten their awareness. Every performer is both rudder and oar. Within the creation process and occasionally in performance as well, anyone can propose a direction. However, unless the others freely choose to row in that direction, there is no movement. Only a litany of propositions. 

### Après-Lazarus
Stanislavski has his magic ‘if’, but I find it too conjectural, too weak. It accepts the world as it is. Like much of contemporary life, it wallows in simplified narration, overemphasizing the theoretical and ignoring the conscience. The Conscience, treated as a leper, has become Lazarus. Wrapped up, written off, buried and left for dead. Conscience is a broken-down lawnmower; it is the unexamined life gathering dust in the corner of the garage. Performance, in its active examination of life-as-it-is-being-lived, re-ignites that engine, bringing it back to life. Offering a model for thoughtfulness, intentionality. Performance offers no answers, but it deepens the questions. That is its après-Lazarus role. 

Too much contemporary performance has been paralysed by cultural relativity. If everything is possible, then nothing matters. Nothing is meant, nothing remains but a chain of Calder mobiles afloat in the theoretical air, utterly divorced from life, proclaiming their cleverness and their absolute inefficacy in the same sotto voce. 
It is not enough. There are only two crucial questions, for the director, for the performer and for the public: ‘What must be?’ and ‘Why?’ Each of us answers differently, and that is the point. The answer is never the same two consecutive days in a row and that is the point. In asking these questions anew each day, we heighten our sensitivity and deepen both our curiosity and our ability to respond in language, in movement and in life. The unexamined life is not worth living. The unlived life is not worth examining.

[tussenkop] Holy Grail
Every creation process centres around the performer. Through a dialogue with the material, the other performers and the director; the performer builds the highest possible degree of self-aware intention. Not in service to the director, but in service to the performer’s truth. Satyagraha as the Holy Grail. ‘Mean it when you do it’. Performance as the Agora. Private language in public space. Intricate rhythms interlacing. Bakhtinian harmonies arising from the cacophonic order. Authenticity arises, and the distinction between observers and practitioners blurs. Every performance centres around the observer. Not simply to watch, but to make sense of it.
The conceptual is one channel of performative communication, but not even the first among equals. Performance is not about, performance is. Full stop. There are emotive, physical, energetic, conceptual levels. The list goes on. The artist’s voice has overtones. Reading the work requires active viewing. Absorbing sensation on all these levels, each observer must make their own hierarchy of these levels within the work. Asking ‘what must be’ and ‘why’. Not only with the head, but with the entire body, all at once. 
Performative work truly exists in two places: at the level of physical reality, that is: the doing by the performers, and in the active viewing by the observers. The observers immerse themselves in the reverie of the work, and then each conjures forth a reverie of one’s own. Le recherché a la reverie perdu. Wherever two or more gather and their reverie’s overlap, that is reality. In all its gloriously messy revolutionary splendour. 

### Revolution
Viva la revolution! Every performer is a revolutionary. Revolving things so that they can be seen from new angles. The more successful performer-revolutionaries find a way to embody Kant’s categorical imperative, acting so that the maxims of their symbolic actions were to encourage universal reflection. I am not proposing an activist theatre in service of a particular ideology. The role of performance is not to promote a specific truth, but to highlight the world-that-is, the world-that-could-be, and the space between. Performance as the Agora. Bakhtinian heteroglossia, a multiplicity of voices within the work. Multiple perspectives, multiple potential interpretations. There is no right nor wrong, only a lot left to discuss. Private language in public space. The performing body as Luther’s printing press. Holy, heretical, heterodox. Killing us softly with its song.
