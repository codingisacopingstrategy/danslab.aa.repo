AVAILABLE is an incubator of choreographic practices that investigates the dialogue and the exchange in the form of a performance. Three chorographers, three cities and three different cultural contexts (Bucharest, Amsterdam, New York) are intersecting in a show that questions the concept of co-authorship in the frame of a contemporary dance performance. Who is the creator of the piece – the one that originally had the idea, the one that has developed it practically or the colleagues that, through feedback, have transformed and put together the material? To what degree could one be available in order to be used and transformed by the other ones?
