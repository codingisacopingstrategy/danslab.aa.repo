The room, where %%choreographer::Robert Steijn|Robert%% & %%dancer::Maria Hassabi|Maria%% show us the beginnings of their new work, is flooded by natural light emerging from the windows on two sides of the four surrounding walls of the Danslab Studio. Above, the fluorescent work lights have been turned on. It is late afternoon, so the brightness comes from an indirect reflection of the sun through shifting clouds; greys, blues and yellows.
Their piece in progress consists -for the present moment- of a simple system of looking at each other right in the eyes. They stand approximately two feet from each other and begin by locking their gazes. This simple act -I realize later- has some of the potential equivalent to %%references::John Cage%%'s famous %%references::John Cage|4'33%%, where the act of uncovering piano keys transforms the expectation of hearing a piece for piano into perceiving the space and its surrounding sound as composition. During the first four minutes of the performance, the audience is suspended within the components of listening and the idea of sound itself -heightening their awareness of the intricacy and complexity of listening consciously.
%%choreographer::Robert Steijn|Robert%% and %%dancer::Maria Hassabi|Maria%%’s gazes will remain locked for the duration of their piece, as we will gradually become aware of the potential of seeing itself.
In order to begin, %%dancer::Maria Hassabi|Maria%% must tilt her head upwards to stare diagonally at %%choreographer::Robert Steijn|Robert%%, placing her hands in her back pockets in order to settle into a posture that allows her to look directly into %%choreographer::Robert Steijn|Robert%%'s eyes whilst staying with herself. She relates this process to the Alexander Technique -staying present and free from strain- as she embarks on a physical challenge. %%choreographer::Robert Steijn|Robert%% stands upright with his arms hanging loosely and relaxed by his side. His downward gaze into %%dancer::Maria Hassabi|Maria%%’s eyes has a less disturbing impact on his frame, as if the act of looking -for the moment- is an act intended for the eyes alone, unrelated and unconnected to the body’s frame.
The two stay in this active %%emotion::stillness%% for a period of five minutes or more, sufficiently long enough for us to settle down and drive away any expectations that we will be seeing more than just this: two people actively looking into each others eyes. It is not a game. You feel them searching for something in this act, a %%concept::connection%%, a point of departure. They are free to %%emotion::laugh%%, be casual and light with themselves and with us. However, their task is not to impress us, but to invite us into their experience.
As part of the audience you notice various human details: the determination and commitment and also the casual ease. But at the same time you take them in from afar. You notice the negative shapes that arise from the borders of their bodies and the altering spaces between their strikingly different forms. They could be statues in a gallery for modern art, reflecting a unique moment of kinship between each other -sharing a task that is fulfilled with intense care. 
What is the occasion for this kind of love?
In the holding and deepening of their gaze, they begin to become jewel-like, reflecting something in this charged %%emotion::stillness%% that is akin to awareness itself. This quality of resonating or brightening seems to extend beyond their joint capacities and also beyond the %%concept::limitations%% of the room in which we sit. This bathing within awareness also results in us going deeper, becoming brighter -like entering into a kind of %%concept::infinity%%.
In this context I would like to return to the importance of natural light. The piece particularly drew my attention as to how my eyes were being affected by the light. My vision became fuller, more panoramic - light itself making vision possible.
At a certain moment they begin to move, or make small adjustments to their posture. Like a film, my internal narrative jump-cuts between a landscape and personal exchange  -a montage of growing plants cutting away to two people having a picnic in the park. My ability to shift my interpretation feels logical because they are reflections of a larger landscape, an %%concept::ecology%% where all of life is connected.
In its entirety, the work reminded me of a phrase from the %%references::Yoga Sutra%% of %%references::Patanyali%% which describes the yogic practice in part as being: ‘a stilling of the fluctuations of consciousnesses’.

This research is about looking into each others eyes. Something I really like to do, also off the stage, although I know it is a tricky thing to engage in. Once I had a lover, who never wanted to look into my eyes. There was a kind of shyness between us; his eyes would always look away. We loved each other, we had great sex, but I always missed the silent dialogue of looking into each others eyes. It felt as if we still kept something to ourselves, something that we didn’t want to share. My lover joked about my obsession for looking each other in the eyes, considering it a highly romantic fantasy.
On one occasion, a collaboration with a friend ended after she experienced that I didn’t really look into her eyes on stage. I didn’t give her the support she needed to be able to continue her part of the play. She said that it was evidence of my problems with women, of being raised by a dominant mother, who’s controlling eyes I couldn’t escape. I on the other hand, considered the act of looking into the eyes of my friend on stage as a symbolic action, without engaging in the possible psychology lying behind it.
The night before my mother died, we looked into each others eyes for hours. Of course we embraced each other a lot, but the eye-to-eye %%concept::connection%% revealed the most about how we felt individually, about our being together. I saw her panic and fear of dying and she in turn saw my sadness at her leaving me behind.
Now I look %%dancer::Maria Hassabi|Maria%% straight in the eyes during the whole performance. This eye-to-eye %%concept::connection%% became the most objective base or common ground that we could find to be together on stage without judging each other. It provoked a heightened awareness of the shifting of the position of our bodies and the space we created between us and around us. 
By looking into each others eyes we engaged each other in the process of moment to moment decision making. The here and now of being together on stage was split into a range of different moments, questioning each time who decided to take the initiative and who decided to follow. This constant change of positions led to a state of mind where the borders between myself and the other became elastic and even for a brief moment erased in a communal moment, a conjunction, where you feel the body of the other as an expansion of your own body. 
This heightened awareness provoked an embodied navigation system which allowed us to move together within time and space. Simultaneously the body took on poses, which were formed by spontaneous decisions which triggered memories and stimulated the imagination.
The eyes are often referred to as the gateway to the soul, to the subconscious. Our own eyes, exposed to the bright light, began to shed tears. This involuntary physical reaction of the body occasionally created an enormous sorrow whilst performing the duet. 
The sorrow softened our presence, our being. 
By obeying this assignment for the eyes on the stage, I place myself upon a path, where I am engaged in discovering myself not only as a performer and a choreographer, but also as a human being with his own unique autobiographical background. 
By zooming in on small shifts in the body -generated by a dialogue of reciprocal impulses and initiatives- we have discovered a reservoir of possibilities capable of generating meaningful theatrical %%concept::connection%% with each other. 
We also realized that the audience could project a great deal of their thoughts and feelings into some of our positions. 
Our desire was to find internal similarities as opposed to the obvious external differences. I think that up until now we have discovered within the research that the basis for our similarities occurs by means of a negotiation between each other. A negotiation through the eyes. Through repetition, both in private and before an audience, I believe our dialogue will gain more emotional depth. 
It will become a flow of emotional energies that move naturally through us, without the need for us to re-enact them.#Photos{: style='left: 1189px; top: 245px;' }

###Event

Presentation of %%project::Research on ecology and presence%%
By %%choreographer::Robert Steijn%% in collaboration with %%dancer::Maria Hassabi%%
Saturday, March 13th / 16hrs Danslab Den Haag

What I saw were two people, a man and a woman, %%choreographer::Robert Steijn%% and %%dancer::Maria Hassabi%% in the Danslab studio, facing, looking at eachother, or maybe even more exact, into each other, using the eyes as the medium to connect, not to observe. They would stay true to this commitment during the 20 minutes of their demonstration. It evolved from standing on the spot with a distance of 50 cm between them, through poses and eventually let to bigger and more complicated movement. Their actions created space and a certain calm to watch. Sometimes I felt far away from their journey and their focus on eachother made me question my place and function as an audience. I was fascinated by the first couple of minutes where ‘nothing happened’ just the standing still on one spot. I observed the most subtile movements of their body, like the swelling of the breast while inhaling, the slight changes of weight moving them back and forth. These are the words that crossed my mind: doubt, love, hunger, denail, glory, power, care, share, damage, play, stubborn, mischief. 
Of what I understood, there was no deliberate movement and the body did not seem to be representing anything but itself; it resonated, it was open and fully present. I want to refer here to “Francis Bacon, The Logic of Sensation”  of Deleuze in which he states that modern art and modern philosophy can be said to have converged on a similar problem: both renounced the domain of representation and instead took the conditions of representation as their object. What Deleuze seems to search for is how the invisible can manifest itself in the form of sensation—a logic (but not a procedure) of how the invisible forces are manifested in the figure (the body), deforming and transforming it. In those first minutes, that is what I saw happening in front of me. The body was not used in a figurative, narrative, nor illustrational way, it became an intensely energetic locus of presence. 
I want to focus on the word “presence” as brought forward by Lepecki in his Exhausting Dance . He writes that presence “is not only a term refering to the dancers negotiation between technical and artistic proficiency in the performance of choreography, it is also a fundamental philisophical concept” (Lepecki 2006:6). Any dance that probes and complicates how it comes into presence, and where it establishes its ground of being, suggests a critical and renewed dialogue with contemporary philosophy for it  creates concepts that allow for a political reframing of the body. Dance in Western tradition is often associated with a “flow and a continuum of movement”(Lepecki2006:2).This was certainly not the case in the first minutes of the showing. Both standing bodies were like an anactment of %%emotion::stillness%%, challenging dance’s own political ontology . According to Nadia Seremetakis in her book The Senses Still Perception and Memory as Material Culture in Modernity , %%emotion::stillness%% is the moment when the buried, the discarded, and the forgotten escape to the social surface of awareness. It is the moment of “exit from historical dust” (Seremetakis 1994:12). Historical dust is not just a metaphor. When taken literally, it reveals how historical forces penetrate deep into the inner layers of the body: dust sedementing the body, fixing the subject within the overly prescribed pathways and steps, fixating movement within certain politics of time and of place. Against the brutality of historical dust literally falling onto bodies, the “stil-act” (Serementakis 1994) reshapes the subject’s stance regarding movement and passing time. The “%%stillness | emotion::still%% act” critically questions modernity’s impulse towards movement and its constant display of mobility. It refers to what Sloterdijk calls “kinetic excess” (Sloterdijk 2000b:26) . It is the insertion of %%emotion::stillness%%, slowing down movement and time, that struck me in this presentation and allowed this research to rethink action and mobility and their place in dance.
