# Luminosity, Amy Cox{: style="top: 30px; left: 30px;" }


The room, where Robert & Maria show us the beginnings of their new work, is flooded by natural light emerging from the windows on two sides of the four surrounding walls of the Danslab Studio. Above, the fluorescent work lights have been turned on. It is late afternoon, so the brightness comes from an indirect reflection of the sun through shifting clouds; greys, blues and yellows.
Their piece in progress consists -for the present moment- of a simple system of looking at each other right in the eyes. They stand approximately two feet from each other and begin by locking their gazes. This simple act -I realize later- has some of the potential equivalent to John Cage's famous ‘4'33’, where the act of uncovering piano keys transforms the expectation of hearing a piece for piano into perceiving the space and its surrounding sound as composition. During the first four minutes of the performance, the audience is suspended within the components of listening and the idea of sound itself -heightening their awareness of the intricacy and complexity of listening consciously.
Robert and Maria’s gazes will remain locked for the duration of their piece, as we will gradually become aware of the potential of seeing itself.
In order to begin, Maria must tilt her head upwards to stare diagonally at Robert, placing her hands in her back pockets in order to settle into a posture that allows her to look directly into Robert's eyes whilst staying with herself. She relates this process to the Alexander Technique -staying present and free from strain- as she embarks on a physical challenge. Robert stands upright with his arms hanging loosely and relaxed by his side. His downward gaze into Maria’s eyes has a less disturbing impact on his frame, as if the act of looking -for the moment- is an act intended for the eyes alone, unrelated and unconnected to the body’s frame.
The two stay in this active stillness for a period of five minutes or more, sufficiently long enough for us to settle down and drive away any expectations that we will be seeing more than just this: two people actively looking into each others eyes. It is not a game. You feel them searching for something in this act, a connection, a point of departure. They are free to laugh, be casual and light with themselves and with us. However, their task is not to impress us, but to invite us into their experience.
As part of the audience you notice various human details: the determination and commitment and also the casual ease. But at the same time you take them in from afar. You notice the negative shapes that arise from the borders of their bodies and the altering spaces between their strikingly different forms. They could be statues in a gallery for modern art, reflecting a unique moment of kinship between each other -sharing a task that is fulfilled with intense care. 
What is the occasion for this kind of love?
In the holding and deepening of their gaze, they begin to become jewel-like, reflecting something in this charged stillness that is akin to awareness itself. This quality of resonating or brightening seems to extend beyond their joint capacities and also beyond the limitations of the room in which we sit. This bathing within awareness also results in us going deeper, becoming brighter -like entering into a kind of infinity.
In this context I would like to return to the importance of natural light. The piece particularly drew my attention as to how my eyes were being affected by the light. My vision became fuller, more panoramic - light itself making vision possible.
At a certain moment they begin to move, or make small adjustments to their posture. Like a film, my internal narrative jump-cuts between a landscape and personal exchange  -a montage of growing plants cutting away to two people having a picnic in the park. My ability to shift my interpretation feels logical because they are reflections of a larger landscape, an ecology where all of life is connected.
In its entirety, the work reminded me of a phrase from the Yoga Sutra of Patanyali which describes the yogic practice in part as being: ‘a stilling of the fluctuations of consciousnesses’.
