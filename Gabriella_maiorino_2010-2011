# AVAILABLE (premiere) {: style='top: 30px; left: 30px; width: 300px; height: 620px;' }


November 15, 19.30: National Museum of Contemporary Arts, Bucharest
November 18, 21.20: Temps d’Images Festival, Cluj-Napoca

AVAILABLE is an incubator of choreographic practices that investigates the dialogue and the exchange in the form of a performance. Three chorographers, three cities and three different cultural contexts (Bucharest, Amsterdam, New York) are intersecting in a show that questions the concept of co-authorship in the frame of a contemporary dance performance. Who is the creator of the piece – the one that originally had the idea, the one that has developed it practically or the colleagues that, through feedback, have transformed and put together the material? To what degree could one be available in order to be used and transformed by the other ones? 

Project idea: Cosmin Manolescu
Direction, choreography & performance: Cosmin Manolescu, Gabriella Maiorino, HeJin Jang
Management & communication: Stefania Ferchedau
Production: Serial Paradise Company / Gabriela Tudor Foundation 
With the financial support of: Administration of the National Cultural Fund, the Embassy of the Kingdom of Netherlands in Bucharest, Dance Theater Workshop’s Suitcase Fund as part of the East/Central Europe Cultural Partnerships Program, supported by the Trust for Mutual Understanding, With the support of: Dancemakers (Amsterdam), Danslab (The Hague), Museum of Contemporary Art in Bucharest and the National Dance Centre in Bucharest. 

Cosmin Manolescu is a choreographer, curator and manager based in Bucharest. 
Gabriella Maiorino is an Italian choreographer based in Amsterdam. 
HeJin Jang is a Korean choreographer based in New York & Seoul.

INTRODUCTION:
The research project "available" started from an idea of TRIANGULATION between 3 choreographers living and working in 3 different countries: NL, Romania and USA. The main idea of the research was to develop a collaboration based mainly on virtual communication: facebook, skype, sms, dropbox, sharing texts, images, video's, sounds. Cosmin Manolescu, Hejin Jang and me met for few days in Holland-Amsterdam DMA and Den Haag Danslab, to have a first "live" meeting in order to understand together in how to proceed on the work alone. The meeting was very inspiring, especially the relation between Cosmin and me has been, from the very first moment, extremely fruitful; we exchanged ideas, stories about our work and our life, physical elements and exercises in order to get to know, even if very shortly a bit of the methods and interests of the other 2.
Afterwards I started my period of research, from may on, in around 3 weeks distributed in a longer time; after I finished my research, Hejin started her own, and, at the end Cosmin did his one. We then met in November in a period of 2 weeks of work in order to create a performative event over available project, which we showed in the Contemporary Art Museum of Bucharest and in the dance festival of Cluj-Napoca (November 2011). Afterwards Cosmin and me decided to continue the project without a fix third partner, and we have been invited to give a masterclass on the project in the event "FRIENDS" in Arnhem, December 2011, for the students of Arnhem dance academy ARTEZ. We'll continue to research on the frame of available with residencies (possibly in Essen, Amsterdam, New York, Romania and Japan). 


RESULT OF MY "alone" AVAILABLE RESEARCH:

The research available was, on the some projects I did in DANSLAB, the most difficult and, at the same time, a research that gave me the opportunity to enter in a very different territory from the ones I already experienced in the past. 
The first big obstacle I immediately encountered was in the heart of the project itself: the use of virtual communication in order to collaborate with partners in an artistic research.
Very soon I realized how abstract and often frustrating is the "absence of the body" in a field that deals primarily with the body; the idea I, almost constantly, had in the studio, was to be surrounded by ghosts, so, not exactly alone, not exactly in company. This strong sensation brought in me little by little to become very abstract myself, which means very much in my thinking activity, much less in the actual body, in the practical reality of "objects". Cosmin and hejin, not being involved in that moment in the studio on the available project as well, were often very slow to answer to my attempts of interactions, and sometime they were not available at all. Which, I understood later-in my turn on being a "supposed available partner", is very easy to understand: today, as artists, most of us are extremely busy in a fragmentation of thousand of activities-performing, talking, studying, rehearsing, teaching, researching, travelling etc
The clearest image which came in my mind about this specific point of frustration was:
You put a message in a bottle, you threw the bottle in the water, but the bottle comes back to you, you open the message and in the message there's a mirror where you see only yourself over and over. Trying to get over this frustration that never really abandoned me, I started to have a sort of "frenetic process" of documenting what I was doing, and, what I was thinking.
This was one of the most interesting element of the process I experienced, cause I normally never documented any phase of my own work-research or rehearsals for a production. It was very interesting cause it came from a very strong personal need of communication with somebody real, but invisible. And not because it is normal to do so, or for practical reasons etc. 
The documentation, the communication and the activity (of researching, of thinking, of moving, of analyzing) have been in this research almost the same thing-at least in my perception.
As, in the same way, another aspect revealed: my being, my thinking, my emotional state of frustration, my mirroring myself and seeing things I didn't want necessarily to see, became immediately one thing with the research; I couldn't "produce" an object outside myself, I couldn't "see" a theme that was not me researching on the research, I couldn't think about the subject but only about the artist in the process of thinking about the subject. And therefore I was filming myself, looking myself in the camera, writing about myself for my partners but also, a lot for me, in a cruel process of almost auto-voyeurism which I didn't plan, but in which I, at least in part, accepted to "fall into" without making resistance.
The "ocean" in which I was swimming was open and obscure, but it was me, this unknown unshaped tangle of brain iper-activities.
I have to confess that this has been, I believe, the most painful process I have been in, but I can see now, with distance, the immense preparation for a new phase of work and, why not, personal life, it helped to go towards. This "empty space", this "non doing, non producing, non orienting yourself. This sense of being suddenly in a labyrinth in which most likely there's no way to a way out, or maybe there is no way out, was one of the most intense experience DANSLAB  has given to me.
The possibility to lay down your weapons-which means your methods, your habits, your efficient and still too known way to research, choose, orientate in the infinite sea of art. The possibility to reflect, actively but also with a sense of passivity, about what you are doing and thinking as an artist, what do you feel, why do you go in a direction and not in another one.
This was my "available" time. A space of ambiguity between being alone and being with other authors; and being alone as a person - being in company with...."facebook" friends as we do everyday. 
I realized, through that period, which part of my life has been dedicated, in the last couple of years at least, to this "virtual world" of  human heat, of artistic exchanges, of soft, distensive, emtions-prouf virtual communication....I ended up this research phase being definitely convinced-not so much mentally, but with my entire being, that I need a bigger percentage of "non abstract human presence" in my daily existence. For the first time I saw all the technology I use everyday not only as a great tool to expand my knowledge in any sense and direction, but also as a medium that allows me to indulge in some aspects of my personality I didn't even accept to see: laziness, fear of too direct contact, fear of what it is unknown.

##DAY 1{: style='left: 1005.25px; top: 445.083px;' }



Ciao ragazzi,
Since when you left the weather has become cold, cloudy. I find myself having a constant flow of brain activity, I would say slightly different from my normal one. I observe myself thinking a lot, with thoughts that don't go exactly anywhere; they develop in sort of spirals, opening up here and there some brilliant intuitions and then collapsing in black holes that suddenly delete the whole path of thinking that happened till then.
 I have so many things to say to you and it's so difficult to find the right coordination of thinking and talking or writing.
 The day I became 40, quite recently, I expressed to myself the desire to become a FABOLOUS 40 something woman: having fun, feeling independent, enjoying fully the pleasure of being just me and of being a woman, with a beautiful work. Somehow the realization of desires is never gonna be exactly the way you expect it to be, but always different, even just a little different.
This project is giving me the measure of that. In my life I constantly struggle between the desire of discipline and coherence and the "carnal" need of deviating from the "right" path, stepping out of discipline, taking the crazy roads, accepting to go somewhere very different from what i have being planning before. Our triangle, the same word available, represent somehow that conflict to me.
Immediately the project, that we create ourselves, is taking me somehow out of my own image of myself and my work, out of my role and of my sense of security. I discovered myself watchig things with the eyes of cosmin or suddenly have an approach with time which i don't recognize as mine, infact is probably from hejin. My personality is milimetrically corrupted. A corruption that makes it becoming more complex, with more leyers, that invite in me seeds of other approaches to life. Under my skin i can feel small gestures of the 2 of you appearing, and sometimes some of your emotions activate in me, leaving me surprised and confused. Like a bit stoned. Is probably the same mechanism of a virus which enters in our organism.
I must confess all this interests me atleast as much as it scares me.
I never had really an "antropological" approach to things around me or towards myself; i have always been much more on the side of philosophy, and somehow psycology. But now i analize my thinking and my emotions as an antropologist would do, something that i recognize comes from our encounter. I still don't know how much happy i'm about this antropolocical thing... :0
 
I don't know how much we will be able to be "radical" with the project, trying to go till the extreme consequences of it, of what we talked together; how much this breaking of the borders between work and emotional life that has already been, will continue and get stronger.How much this "game" between reality and fiction, or between an identity and another one, will arrive to a deep level. I'm fascinated by that. I somehow know that I'm a radical person.I know that when i start a journey i want to go till the end of it, taking with me all the implications that the travelling will bring.
At the same time I feel the need to tell to you and to myself about this specific feeling of  fear that accompanied me since the first moment we started to work and be together at this project.
To explain you better i'll tell you this little story:
I have been in italy recently in a journey with my, let's say, lover and I proposed him to walk in the mountains during the night. When we started to walk he was still talking...you know about many things,little concrete things that for me represented both an anchor to the reality that we were going away from-the reality where you see and recognize every thing around you, with a sense of confidence that make you feel safe- and at the same time an intolerable, trivial act of denying that we were not in that confortable environment anymore. So, I asked him to shut up. Even though his talking was making me feeling sicure. It sounded so familiar in a totally non familiar BLACK environment.  And then, keeping walking and walking for quite some time in complete silence all kind of fears and at the same time fascinations emerged in myself, so strongly...it was some time that i didn't experience that.
All the things i have been working on in the last years-the sense of wildness, the unknown, the dark, loosing any reference point to orientate yourself, all the emotions totally exposed, your body totally exposed, the animals, teh mistery they carry with them, the non controllable power of what we call nature, the thoughts that start abandoning a linear path and  go wild like horses you can't contain anymore; but all this in a mix of adrenaline and powerful images, and such a sense of creativity, creation, inspirations. Such a scary state!   and still, i said to myself, how can i be an artist if in the last years i didn't give the time and the space to myself to reach this creative and emotional state often? How can I touch certain subjects, if i don't continue to experience this state on my own skin?
All this was nurishing me a lot. And yet, I realize how many times i stay away from it, protected  by my role of choreographer that push the others to experience the extreme emotions and guide them without being, in practice, fully involved in it.
 
In this our project I feel a little piece of the feeling in the forest: the possibility to loose myself in it.
The fear is also that i could end up not being the mature, in control person that i want to think i'm, the experienced artist that the environment convinced me to be. What happens if i discover that i'm not at all that person?

 
I talked a bit with cosmin about the power-sort of uncontrollable power- of the triangle. I experienced that at least a couple of times before. even more than in a duet or couple i believe it generate forces that rebounce constantly in slightly different ways towards each other and i think somehow is not easy to find a way out when you want to take one. It can become difficult to open a triangle to the outside world, cause there's enough space there inside to explore for quite a while, but at the same time is not a group big enough so that the energies just regenerate by themselves inside the group naturally.I feel there's something almost esotheric, or spiritual in it .....
But i tell you this also because i always perceived there's quite a "witchy" part in me-knowing things before they happen, feeling the emotions of the other people strongly on my own skin, perceiving clearly a danger when there is one etc etc-and maybe now it will be a place where to let this part of me talk more. I like the idea! A running rabbit, a wicth on a flying broom...and what else?

-----------------------


I'm wondering how much we will be able to bring all this...substance, which is quite ethereal  in the "actual work"; Or maybe how much i have to take in consideration that the "actual work" is somehow already this, what we are experiencing in between us and inside each of us. And that is some how not tangible.
I could maybe learn to let go of the invisible walls that in my mind still divide the personal life and the work. I always criticized the society because it forces all of us to build this walls, and then i see myself having the same structures. You see? This project is a mirror. Or, better, a game of multiple mirrors. Another Alice in Wonderland, a bit of Bulgakov, probably some Fellini. And of course, all our talks about sex....isn't it?


 
I'm still swimming in a sea of emotions. they pull me and push me here and there with no logic. It seems cahotic...
I wonder what i will do in the studio from tomorrow on...
 
mistery, definitely a big mistery :)

Hope you are well,
 
love
gab

##DAY 2
(sad lullaby, from villagers's song)


CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW
CALLING FROM THIS BED
WHEN THE MOMENT COMES
THERE'S NOTHING HERE

CAN YOU HEAR MY VOICE
LYING IN THIS BED
THERE'S NO MUSIC LEFT ON MY SELFISH FACE

CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW
SCREAMING FROM THIS SQUARE
THERE'S NO SONG INSIDE
IN BETWEEN MY LEGS

CAN YOU READ MY WORDS
WHEN THE TONGUE COLLAPSE
PLEASE MAKE UP SOME GAMES
FOR MY LONELY ROOM

CAN YOU HEAR MY TEARS
ROLLING DOWN MY BREASTS
THEY BECOME RED STARS IF YOU LET THEM STAY

CAN YOU SEE  THE SPACE JUST OUTSIDE THIS BED
FILLED TODAY WITH TREES
BREAD AND PAIN AND WINE

CAN YOU SEE MY VOICE
RUNNING OUT THE DOOR
MIXING UP WITH ROMANCE

SKY IS TURNING WHITE

WANT TO BUILD A CASTLE?
JUST OUTSIDE THIS GLASS


CAN YOU SEE MY FINGER
INDICATING LOVE
GENTLY PUT IT DOWN
HIDE THE DREAM AWAY
HIDE THE LIGHT AND RUN

CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW
SITTING IN THIS TRAIN
SHAKING FAST MY LIFE
SPINNING IN THE CLOUDS

SKY IS TURNING RED
PEOPLE GO AND STAY
I CAN CRY OUT LOUD
ONLY GHOSTS CAN HEAR

WHEN THE MOMENT COMES
THERE IS NOTHING LEFT

YOU WILL TAKE YOUR RAIN
WASHING OUT MY SMELL
OH, I KNOW HOW IT FEELS
PURIFYING GUILT

CAN YOU TASTE MY VOICE
RESTING IN THIS SQUARE
BIRDS AND POETS LEFT
I RECALL A ROOM
FILLED WITH WORDS AND FLESH

THAT WAS YOU AND ME
FALLING FROM THE SKY
SPINNING IN THE CLOUDS
SHAKING FAST AND CRYING

CAN YOU HEAR MY BREATH
EVERYTIME I SING
PUT A SPACE BETWEEN
YOUR ILLUSIONS AND MINES

I'VE NO PICTURES LEFT
TO CREATE A TRUTH
LYING IN MY BED
I FORGOT THE DAY

CAN YOU SEE MY EYES
OPEN ON THE MOON
IF YOU CHOOSE TO PRAY
I CAN'T COME ALONG

CAN YOU HEAR MY FEAR
IS THE LOUDEST SONG
IS THE BIGGEST GIFT
I CAN THINK FOR YOU






DAY 3

dancing with right foot
with left foot
hands and fingers
belly
mouth
sides of the torso


i missed another body to touch with my feet

sides of the torso provoked an amazing power and rage, and energy towards the outside

voice came
loud and strong

i felt a witch, bad, angry and terrifying
was good

it became a cartoon

absurd talks

i looked for my "real voice"-atleast one that doesn't hurt in the throat
found only in some moments

my tongue out towards the ceiling
saying things i never said. powerful and funny
egotic
i'm a nazy character of a brilliant surrealstic cartoon
i'm the emperor of the planet and my tongue wants to go up, on the floor above, on the roof, beyond the roof, in the sky
but i can't. my feet oblige me to be stuck here, in between these miserable beings, which are humans beings. incredible. me, the emperor, stuck here, in between these poor people.  a punk sense of power. a funny sense of ridicolous.
really cool. totally lysergic!

then i put some atmospheric nice music and lye down just to breath and remember the impression of the journey i had

instead
i hear my voice talking, i'm a bit surprised and i just listen what it is saying






don't look at me





please don't watch me








look somewhere else




please







i'm not here




 don't look at me





forget  me






please, forget me






when i stand up, i felt this could have been the end of my piece 
and maybe it is the beginning of my life, as a child.
I guess my parents were too busy when i was born, so they didn't really see me, they were keeping forgetting about me sometimes when i was in the room. i was very little, maybe before 1 year or just bit later. They told me: ah, you were so quiet...that we kept forgetting about you. And i didn't talk. for long, quite a long time

and then i shift to now, the present. From this position i see my life, my past.
I fighted a lot. to be visible, maybe, to exist and affirm and confirm my unicity, the unicity of being.
I have been strong and taff and went through all kind of adventures.
i only couldn't deal with being left, abandoned, when people, any kind of people, even the less important for me, abandoned me there, alone.

this is my pain
this is me, being a child

so, never believe when it looks like i'm a LADY

i'm not a lady

non sono una signora!



PS-i need a microphone. a rope, the one you use to jump with and play-with condoms attached to it. i need sun.
PS1-in the dropbox you can hear "non sono una signora", Loredana Berte' ( u know how to use the dropbox?)

But I tell you this also because I always perceived there's quite a "witchy" part in me-knowing things before they happen etc etc-and maybe now it will be a place where to let this part of me talk more.
I'm wondering how much we will be able to bring all this and more in the "actual work"; Or maybe how much I have to take in consideration that the "actual work" is somehow already this, what we are experiencing in between us and inside each of us.
I could maybe learn to let go of the invisible walls that in my mind still divide the personal life and the work. I always criticized the society because it forces all of us to build this walls, and then I see myself having the same structures. You see? This project is a mirror. Or, better, a game of multiple mirrors.

I swim in a see of emotions. they pull me and push me here and there with no logic.
I wonder what I will do in the studio from tomorrow on...

mystery, big mystery :)

ciao ragazzi,
since when you left the weather has become cold, cloudy. I find myself having a constant flow of brain activity, I would say slightly different from my normal one. I observe myself thinking a lot, with thoughts that don't go exactly anywhere; but they develop in sort of spirals, opening up here and there some brilliant intuitions and then collapsing in black holes that suddenly delete the whole path of thinking that happened till then.

I have so many things to say to you and it's so difficult to find the right coordination of thinking and talking or writing.

The day I became 40, quite recently, I expressed to myself the desire to become a FABOLOUS 40 something woman: having fun, feeling independent, enjoying fully the pleasure of being just me and of being a woman. Somehow the realization of desires is never going to be exactly the way you expect it to be, but always different, even just a little different.
This project is giving me the measure of that. In my life I constantly struggle between the desire of discipline and coherence and the "carnal" need of deviating from the "right" path, stepping out of discipline, taking the crazy roads, accepting to go somewhere very different from what I have being planning before. Our triangle, the same word available, represent somehow that conflict.
Immediately the project, that we create ourselves, is taking me somehow out of my own image of myself and my work, out of my role and of my sense of security. I discovered myself watching things with the eyes of Cosmin or suddenly have an approach with time which I don't recognize as mine, infact is probably from Hejin. My personality is milimetrically corrupted. A corruption that makes it becoming more complex, with more layers, that invite in me seeds of other approaches to life. Under my skin I can feel small gestures of the 2 of you, and sometimes some of your emotions activate in me, leaving me surprised and confused. Is probably the same mechanism of a virus which enters in our organism.
I must confess all this interests me at least as much as it scares me.
I never had really an "anthropological" approach to things around me or towards myself; I have always been much more on the side of philosophy, and somehow psychology. But now I analyze my thinking and my emotions as an anthropologist would do, something that I recognize comes from our encounter. I still don't know how much happy I'm about this anthropological thing...

I don't know how much we will be able to be "radical" with the project, trying to go till the extreme consequences of it, of what we talked together; how much this breaking of the borders between work and emotional life that has already been, will continue and get stronger. How much this "game" between reality and fiction, or between an identity and another one, will arrive to a deep level. I'm fascinated by that. I somehow know that I'm a radical person. I know that when I start a journey I want to go till the end of it, taking with me all the implications that the travelling will bring.
At the same time I feel the need to tell to you and to myself about this specific feeling of  fear that accompanied me since the first moment we started to work and be together at this project.
To explain you better I'll tell you this little story:
I have been in Italy recently in a journey with my, let's say, lover and I proposed him to walk in the mountains during the night. When we started to walk he was still talking...you know about many things, little concrete things that for me represented both an anchor to the reality that we were going away from-the reality where you see and recognize every thing around you, with a sense of confidence that make you feel safe- and at the same an intolerable, trivial act of denying that we were not in that comfortable environment anymore. So, I asked him to shut up. Even though his talking was making me feeling secure. And then, keeping walking and walking for quite some time in complete silence all kind of fears and at the same time fascinations emerged in myself, so strongly...it was some time that I didn't experienced that.
All the things I have been working on in the last years-the sense of wildness, the unknown, the dark, loosing any reference point to orientate, all the emotions totally exposed, your body totally exposed, the animals, the mysterious power of what we call nature, the thoughts that start abandoning a linear path and they go wild like horses you can't contain anymore; but all this in a mix of adrenaline and powerful images, and such a sense of creativity, creation, inspirations. Such a scary state! and still, I said to myself, how can I be an artist if in the last years I didn't give the time and the space to myself to reach this creative and emotional state often? How can I touch certain subjects, if I don't continue to experience this state on my own skin?
All this was nourishing me a lot. And yet, I realize how many times I stay away from it, protected  by my role of choreographer that push the others to experience the extreme emotions and guide them without being fully involved in it.

In this our project I feel a little piece of the feeling I had in the forest at night; the possibility to loose myself in it.
The fear is also that I could end up not being the mature, in control person that I want to think I'm, the experienced artist that the environment, or myself,  convinced me to be.

I talked a bit with cosmin about the power-sort of uncontrollable power- of the triangle. I experienced that at least a couple of times before. Even more than in a duet or couple I believe it generate forces that rebounce constantly in slightly different ways towards each other and I think somehow is not easy to find a way out when you want to take one. It can become difficult to open a triangle to the outside world, cause there's enough space there inside to explore for quite a while, but at the same time is not a group big enough so that the energies just regenerate by themselves naturally. I feel there's something almost esoteric, or spiritual in it .
But I tell you this also because I always perceived there's quite a "witchy" part in me-knowing things before they happen etc etc-and maybe now it will be a place where to let this part of me talk more.
I'm wondering how much we will be able to bring all this and more in the "actual work"; Or maybe how much I have to take in consideration that the "actual work" is somehow already this, what we are experiencing in between us and inside each of us.
