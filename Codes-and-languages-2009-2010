Observations by Olivier van Nooten 






##New exercise
 
Interest is not intention
Intense interaction still
In ten seconds all boundaries dissolve...
		           until


 
Vangen: ontvangen: ontvankelijk

Het lijkt of – nee het lijkt op
niets tenzij betekenis vereist is
ontkom ik niet aan invulling
wanneer mijn hoofd de lijn mist?

Zeg mezelf: het mag, het mag
te zien zonder begrijpen, als een
danser in verwarring plots stopt
en net als ik er bij zit
 
##Crash along

Hear all bodies twist
and shout to overcome
gravity and time enough
for lines beyond beginning

(but not for long
on butt fur lung)

to an end means nothing 
less then just for now 
forgotten

rest your head 
to leave the neck 
only muscles 
move and sing

##Ga op

Voeten voelen vloer ze
tasten nog te lopen paden af 
en aandacht langzaam langs
verzonken in gedachten of 
zonder plan boven de bodem.

In een hoek gekozen kijk ik toe
steeds bewuster van mijn houding
tot dansend over blad de inkt me 
meedogenloos in lijnen vergeet






##Breaking the gaze

Eyes never leave the window
so how fragile is the audience
intended so transparent even
dialogue might go through
when suddenly the rules bend
and language unknown giggles


 
##“If you want it to happen, don’t say it”

en tussen regels door bewegen
woorden rond gelande dansers
grond heeft ze gevonden nu
ze zitten kijken horen spreken.

Frisse lucht daagt tevergeefs
de neergestreken wezens uit
toch toe te geven aan de tocht
gedoofd gedogen ze gebogen
 
##History repeating

Connected to what happened
movements explore the next
past, then again dismantled
by the need to be progressive

how personal the skin and still
will untouched land be found
if eyes are clear enough not to 
look back in search of contrast




 
##Uit de lamp

De richting laat zich raden
loopt uit de hand en voeten
nee verder nog, van top tot
teen of weer en heen of voor 
het eerst de geest is los gelaten
 
##Paradox

Ze draaien om hun as
de rollen tot het onderste
verstrikt weer boven ligt
maar nu ontdaan van stof

knap lastig is te vangen
wat wil vliegen om te zijn
als de leden maten tekens 
niks te maken hebben met


 
##Blisters

Frames on fire
heat their feet,
the need to feel
free from flames

enlightened by the
tired flesh in death
no generations lost
longing for fresh

##Danslab Series  
The codes and languages in the relationship between choreographers and dancers
Den Hague 2010
 
 
Hereby my reflections produced by the encounters …when I say this (‘hereby my reflections produced by the encounters’) it does not mean that I have produced thoughts. Certainly, I was witnessing (partly participating in) encounters of opinions. And it is what I found very empowering, the possibility of that to happen, however I am very curious how that (the last session) will turn into a thought…What will be the product of this encounters? Can it be proud of itself and able to walk on the dance field ? 
From my observations (summer) …
I have made a simplistic division at the very beginning in order to have a fair base for my thoughts. I have made my own encounter by saying: Lets equal language to a specificity of a choreographic idiom, like a specificity of a language that is governed by grammatical rules etc, and additionally lets equal the code to generally understood systems of rules that helps to produce or interpret signs (social codes).
 
Concluding, via my simplistic division. Gabriella is open to invite all possible and impossible propositions that would inform and transform her understanding of a code and even the language she uses, whereas Andrea does not question the understanding of the code but welcomes different personalities to interpret what she proposes as a language. 
 
A short conclusion…
Now, I will try to be very concise about where this encounters brought me. It goes like this: Language, partly, constitutes on construction of sense. This sense often falls into regimes of certain logic. Any logic is quite impossible because it possesses capacities for self-destruction, an encounter is a potential for that to happen. Different set of arguments plus different sets of arguments will end up in the possible conflict. To put this into rehearsal: an encounter between a choreographer and a chorographer or a dancer with a choreographer etc. --- each caring different set of ideas, expectations, desires, knowing and not knowing, translating knowledge and interpreting knowledge will not easily slide without resistance. The resistance is needed. The resistance is needed because it must create a positive ambiguity a kind of silence that will feed the process of re-thinking ones own assumptions. 
After questions I asked …
 
When I entered the sessions, I came with a topic zooming into a question: This observation will focus around the area of power relationship between a performer and a choreographer. My question is; what are the features of a relationship between a dancer and a choreographer when a strong, fixed code-language is at work?  What are the forms of agreement? After participating, and zooming into insights I ended up making more questions… The power relationships are always at work; there is no freedom as such, because things inherently condition us. Therefore, one should reflect upon such constructions of conditionings, and when such does exist--- how this function not in terms of craftiness but in terms of it’s structuring (what assumptions build this relationship etc.)… Can we talk why we make dance? Can we talk about what made us make the dance we make? Can we talk about why we dance? What those needs reflect? Do you have sense ethics when you think about your practice? 
At the end, I am quite triggered and curious what this encounters will bring in terms of alliances …

Danslab 
The codes and languages in the relationship between choreographers and dancers

by Cristina Planas Leitão 											Den Haag 2010


I have to say that first of all, no matter what analysis we make of our behaviour in the studio, in relation with other people, in this case the relation dancer – choreographer, we can never discard our personal experiences and personality.
Many factors condition this relation, as any other relations, and they can go from silly things of how people look like and what we previously know about them to simple words they say or just 1st impressions. We are all full of Pygmalion effects and things such as expectations, interests and pre-conceived ideas, and all of those play, in my point of view a big role in these relations and its language.
For sure we all remember that we are people even before being dancers or choreographers.

My general interests before starting this frame are still the same. They remain questions which I believe make part of a long, long term research:

-Which information do I receive better as a dancer? What triggers me the most?
-As a director/choreographer/ teacher: how much information is enough and when is it too much? What is most efficient for creation: a clear task or a more metaphorical instruction?
-How does the fact that I like or not the work I am performing influences my performance and how do I still make it work?
-Specificity or Versatility (as a dancer)?
-Dancer or Performer?
-What's the ground 0 for the common language of dance?
-Importance of research? Does it become a product when it is shown? What are the by-products of it? Waste? What of it becomes production?
-What are the main differences in result and behaviour of a research period and a production period?
-Do we still research when we perform?
-What are the unspoken areas between dancers and choreographers?
-What’s the potentially of this Almost Something area.





“Communication is a process whereby information is enclosed in a package and is channelled and imparted by a sender to a receiver via some medium. The receiver then decodes the message and gives the sender a feedback. 

All forms of communication require a sender, a message, and an intended recipient. Communication requires that all parties have an area of communicative commonality. There are auditory means, such as speech, song, and tone of voice, and there are nonverbal means. 
Nonverbal communication (NVC) is usually understood as the process of communication through sending and receiving wordless messages. i.e., language is not the only source of communication, there are other means also. NVC can be communicated through gestures and touch (Haptic communication), by body language or posture, by facial expression and eye contact. NVC can be communicated through object communication such as clothing, hairstyles or even architecture, symbols and info graphics. Speech contains nonverbal elements known as paralanguage, including voice quality, emotion and speaking style, as well as prosodic features such as rhythm, intonation and stress. Dance is also regarded as a nonverbal communication. 
However, much of the study of nonverbal communication has focused on face-to-face interaction, where it can be classified into three principal areas: environmental conditions where communication takes place, the physical characteristics of the communicators, and behaviours of communicators during interaction.” 
And this is just Wikipedia ☺







##Encounter 1 (19th June 2010)

(Gabriella Maiorino with me and Valentina & Mor Shani with Stav Dror and Reut Shemesh)


I remember that one of the very first questions that arose on this day (and not just because of the choreographers in question but as this was the very first day of this project) was about the moment of passing information. Is it only choreographer to dancer or also the other way around?

Most certainly this question got an answer. For sure, we dancers also give a feedback in response to the stimulation provoked (see definition of communication above), otherwise would be like talking to a wall. Above all in the last periods of my own personal research and after some workshops in the last period, I figured out that the ones that are in the studio, on stage – the dancers – we have the ultimate power on the choreographer’s work if we talk about power relationships and assuming they are in a post audition/employer/employee phase. So yes, for me the communication is definitely both ways no matter the form and shape of the answer.

I also can’t ignore all that I know beforehand about the new choreographer that I am meeting.
However for these encounters I tried my best to walk in with an empty head and my premise was to fully trust the person I am meeting for the “first” time. This behaviour doesn’t happen for me many times in auditions for instance, where I also meet someone for the first time. I think for this case it was extremely important to try to erase all pre-conceived ideas about someone and to not judge too much.

We focused and discussed a lot about the very first moment of passing information. Therefore it becomes interesting for me to also talk about how to pass information.
Personally I am busy at the moment finding effective communication skills as a teacher, how much information do I give, do I use a metaphorical speech, an analytical one, do I simply give tasks, do I talk in a trippy text?
All this, conditions my understanding as a dancer of the choreographer’s proposal. To this problematic, Gabriella answered that, many times, in an instruction the contradiction of a task can bring some good tension to it. For instance in stead of saying “Now, do it in 1 minute”; Say “Now, do it in 1 minute BUT with the feeling of plenty of time”. Personally, I consider this a very important step into communicating because I think most of the times choreographers don’t just want to communicate with the dancers, they actually want to provoke some sort of happening and we dancers/performers are the vehicle for it.

Is it that they want to communicate and we are the receivers of their message? Or is the public the ultimate receiver and we, dancers, are the medium for that message to be delivered. I start to believe that it is more the second.

This is totally out of context but recently I spent some time in a workshop/ process with Meg Stuart and even in a class/ research context she would do the transitions between the exercises as if we were on stage.
She would never stop and say: “Ok, now we go on to the next exercise”. She would just whisper to each of us, tell some of us to tell the others, just do it herself and non-verbally show us something, etc.
This space of ambiguity – the space where something can almost happen - this “almost something” moments (not the “I’m a tiger” moment but maybe the “I’m almost a tiger but…” moments) are the ones were I think the potentially of creation resides, and these are the moments comprised in contradictory instructions, in vague speeches and in body language of non-verbal communication. These are the moments that give space for individual creativity where it can be this or maybe that. All this to say I felt this “almost” moments in Mor’s session where the warm-up merged with research and work session.

Of course I am talking on a personal taste level. When I speak about creation for me it relates more to states rather than steps or shapes and to eventually more improvised scores instead of fixed ones. But somehow I believe that this “Almost Something” space can be quite interesting as well for the “execution” of set material.

For me, this answers as well to the question of how much space does a choreographer leave to the dancer and about what is the role of the spoken word in these relations.
Of course it all depends of what kind of process and result you want to achieve.

There was also the question of how fast and actually how does a dancer adapt to a new choreographer. Personally, I don’t consider this such and important one. I don’t think we were part of an experiment here and I would place this in a more curiosity level. It’s like every relation. Some people we figure out sooner and others later.

More practical questions of how to prepare the dancers for the work and how to use them as a complex being also came to play. For me this also has to do with which methodologies you choose and which are your personal beliefs and what parts of the complex being you want to actually prepare: the personal, the physical, the spiritual one?
I do agree that many times the definition of the word “dancer” brings me to a place that I am not that anymore, specially after the “So you think you can dance” era and therefore from now on I will use the term performer, which can maybe bring me to a more elitist and pseudo-intellectual world but it defines better “a dancer” in her/his full complexity as a person. Performer means to me a more multi-layered being.

One of Mor’s questions was also: How to achieve the necessary intimacy in the studio?
I believe that Trust and Intimacy are very important factors that condition the work, especially in such a short period of time.
I felt very comfortable in the environment created that day. For me Availability, Adaptability and Negotiation are extremely important contributors to build the trust and intimacy required in a process.
Somehow I connect Mor more to intimacy and later on I could connect Jack to Trust. I don’t really know why yet, but I will go on that later….
Ambiguity: Mor's work session allowed space and freedom for me. Although I went through moments of doubt the fact that the task was not so clear made me go my own way. However I felt I could trust Mor in the way he was leading us. And as mentioned above I think he succeeded in creating this sphere of almost something environment.

I don’t know whether it is interesting to go deeply on each choreographer’s working session or not….
Anyhow, Mor drove us through a long working session that merged the warm up with the exploring/creating process.
From his work some aspects remained with me such as: the voices inside of us, the resonance of the place were I am in the room and how that affects the space itself and the others, the void, the social parameter of his work.

We spoke a lot about parameters of the work or possible ways to define the situation that you see from the audience point of view.
I consider this a very important tool to see the work. Yes, it can help us define it but can also help us to really go through with what we want to say and give it a little twist. We can change of course the space, the speed, dynamics, the colours, but we can change in our imagination numerous things, like our age, our appearance, or substance matter, being dead or alive and keep on doing the same instruction for instance.

Regarding definitions, I have to say I don’t agree so much with defining the work with more emotional, or theatrical or physical etc (referring to Reut about Gabriella's research and the emotional interpretation of the physical task). For me, as a performer, something very important is to achieve a state instead of a shape. The state for me opens infinite possibilities and therefore I don’t have the need to categorize the sort of action or emotion - they would be part of that same state. I see it from a complex point of view and in that case, the emotionality wouldn’t come on top of it, but would be part of it as almost a tornado coming upwards from within. 

Of course Gabriella's process was more familiar to me. The fact that we started with a clear physical task that gives the whole work a common layer and establishes a ground and the fact that I have also learnt to accept certain things like that kind of method. And my question is how to I get freedom within something that I know so well. It’s almost like doing a daily action everyday in a different way… I guess by constantly questioning it (not judging it) and seeing it with fresh eyes every time.

At the end of this day, for me it was very interesting to compare both "final" researches as different types of landscapes and describe the space, as I perceive it from inside.
Gabriella’s stage as being full from a point of departure and almost like spiralling up in intensity, having a specific physicality as a common ground for the performers and somehow lacking a counterpoint in it and Mor departing from an empty and more social stage, focusing on individuality and the fact that the “normality” can become anything through achieving a free mind without being blank.


I think the beauty of research is, many times, the fact that we don’t really know where we are going nor what is the purpose….





 


##Encounter 2 (26th June 2010)

(Gabriella Maiorino with me and Valentina & Jack Gallagher with Marjolein Vogels, Tan Temel and Sernaz Demirel)


For the second encounter I was more prepared and I could imagine a bit better what to expect.
I was also very curious to meet Jack and see how he approaches his work. 

We knew already he wanted to work with counter direction (with the key element for the day being direction: combined directions influence each other to create and 3rd movement event) and the physical side of the work. In a previous e-mail he had posed the question of how does a concept for movement, bridge the paradox of the mind/ body split and what’s the connection between the stuff of movement and the engagement of the dancer. 

Immediately in the beginning of this 2nd day it was clear that, for everyone, complexity was a big issue: In a personal level (dancer VS performer), in a research process level, in a product/ result level, in the information/ communication level.

I felt somehow very fascinated by Jack from the beginning and as I said before I think that also played a role in the trust that I somehow felt (and also decided to feel). I wanted to believe that he knew what he was doing and that he has a very strong artistic vision and would let us be part of his universe.
We spoke briefly about concepts that I would have liked to elaborate more on and eventually was not possible: self-censorship, violence-demand, exposure & comfort, trust and intimacy.

I got stuck with the idea of the body and mind split and realized I see it more as a whole – maximum, for me the body is a tool of what I call myself. I think my definition of finding a state could be an answer for bridging that paradox.

The self-censorship plays a huge role in creation. I do think it is important to question but I wonder the need to judge. Also because I’ve been in that position many times and I wonder if it is helpful. Also, according to John Cage, analyzing and creation are two very different processes and they shouldn’t be done together - I agree.
About the violence demand I was wondering If that has to do with the constant demand that choreographers have more and more on dancers excelling themselves. I wonder…

The warm-up given by Jack was extremely interesting for me. It was almost like exploring a totally different approach to movement for me. The most relevant aspects for me were the concepts of falling away horizontally, the idea of always having a counter direction, these invisible forces that are the directions, mechanisms of action and what/ how much investment we put in them (deconstruction of the mechanics of the movement), the simple and great notion that initiation, no matter, what always comes from your head (idea), mechanical body.

I don’t know why Jack asked if we were having fun while we were doing it. And I also don’t know why that shocked me extremely at that moment. Only today, after teaching I understood it. It is amazing how we constantly search for acceptance in what we are doing and how the fact that we please the other (students in my case) is so important for us. I see now, that we mostly give in to them in search of their recognition and we hope that they enjoy their moment with us and that’s when we start to fall apart.
I was not having fun at that moment but I was definitely enjoying it because I’m aware of the benefits of it and even if it was a warm-up I took it as a research. I needed time to dive deep in the complexity of his proposal. That was the moment that Jack gives and I take, in the sense that I try to go towards him more than the other way around. I don’t enjoy all processes day by day but I might enjoy them at the end of it all… Many of them carry conflicts and struggle and maybe those are the ones that I actually enjoyed the most.

I concluded also that for me is important to empty my mind to be able to receive new knowledge but not empty my previous experience (and that’s what stops me from neutrality) and that there is a huge power of the imagination in both Jack and Gabriella.

In Jack’s work session he manifested interest in how the material is generated and the dual experience of investigating something specific and unlocking your mind within.
Jack introduced many big and interesting concepts for me that I had to digest through time.

Then came another question of value, when Jack asked what of what we had been doing would have a stage value. It gather so much about the “how much do we say to the dancers, how much do we share with them, how much ambiguity is needed to create” and also it triggers one of my main questions:  How does the fact that I like or not the work influence my performance and how do I still make it work for me and for the choreographer?
And then on my mind I asked, a value for who? For me, for Jack, for the audience??
What was more interesting for me was the base of it – the shift of gravity to the side and to constantly fall horizontally and therefore its exploration into radically and the idea of the darkness of the centre. 

I wonder how for choreographers the fact that the dancers like their work is so important.
Somehow, from then on I had to question everything I did before. If I like it the choreographer uses it on stage, if not, not. Is it so? Then yes, the power is totally on the “dancers” in the creation and I question myself what is the pure core of the artistic input of the choreographer if he himself questions the value of it. And from that another question comes: How much democracy can there be in a process and how hierarchized is it? Does the “value” of something have to do with the fact of that “something” becoming the end product, a by-product, a waste, or just research? And are conflicts beneficial for a process or should we just avoid them?


My other two “revelations” of the day:

Acknowledgment: as in we do it for an audience and we take time for them to understand what we say, like what we do in verbal communication. If the audience wouldn’t be there we wouldn’t do it probably.

Triangulation: in this case, the way of looking of the performers has a lot of power. Performers should have the power or then, share it with the audience. When we give all the power to the audience they will eventually burn out. The same when two performers are too close to each other, there’s no space for a 3rd element – the audience. “Sustaining the tension of engagement”.

Jack also re-introduced the idea of presenting instead of re-presenting and said something that I think is directly related to communication in performance and can be applied in the relation dancer-choreographer: “You have to have power to communicate. You can’t loose power, not change anything and get it back. You have to change something in order to get it back.”



After that we had the work session of Gabriella: Open work, no fixed qualities, no states, nothing, time frame of 20min, a starting point and an ending point.
We should not feel like we had to entertain the audience but on the other hand, everything we do, we should do it for them, without cutting the power lines and not offering it all; attempting to touch the range of infinite possibilities in the time/space frame given, not making too easy choices.

Exposure/ Freedom of infinity
How can you be free, keeping the tension? How does that not block you?
Getting rid of tricks and devices to “make it work”.

Gabriella was not interested in kilos of physical activity, which could have been misled by her warm-up. However she is interested in the complexity of the being.

How do feedbacks condition my freedom? Do I have to co-respond to certain expectations the 2nd time around? The judging viewer does condition my freedom!

Are our choices free? Getting rid of habits is not it. It would be doing the habits and knowing you are doing them and actually choosing for them.

The Freedom issue is extremely interesting for me and I will continue about it in the next parts…. 
(to be continued).


#erin - second day final draft


Example of a written documentation:
Danslab second day: Gabriella Maiorino and Jack Gallagher
I was very curious to witness the working processes of Jack Gallagher and Gabriella Maiorino, their commonalities and stark differences.  During the first Edition of these encounters several  areas of interest had been established such as;  How information from the choreographer is received and processed by the dancer, the personal motivations of the dancer, the terminology used in the creative process, the use of weight, how to initiate the process and the topic of complexity.
Interestingly, these same topics sprang up during the second editions initial group conversation when trying to ascertain common areas of interest. There were also a couple of additions; how one can create a situation where movement and theatricality develop symbiotically (so that neither one is added as an after- thought ) and the challenge of how to allow both  dancer and choreographer to achieve a mental ‘ state’ or ‘ flow’ which will give rise to productivity and creativity but also can be used as a tool to unify the choreographer and dancer. According to the SantaTeresaLaboratory, It typically takes about 15 minutes of uninterrupted study to get into a state of ‘flow’ but whether this same time frame can be applied to dance is something I think is worthy of some exploration. However, the aspect  of ‘State’ and ‘flow’ that I was most interested in during this initial discussion was whether  achieving it is a joint responsibility between choreographer and dancer or whether the onus was on one party more than the other. 
How the choreographers ‘information is received and processed became immediately relevant during the joint warm of Gabriella and Jack. I observed that the familiarity of the working concepts greatly altered the efficiency of this process. To give an example; Gabriella had requested that the dancers allow themselves to be pushed by the space whilst keeping a constant emphasis on dropping their weight. Weight was evidently a familiar concept for all of the participating dancers yet being pushed by the space was not and this was apparent. Familiarity may not have been the only determining factor in this. I believe that complexity may also have been an influence. Within the context of this research, complexity can be categorized into three areas; the complexity of the dancer; their history, body type and character, that of the choreographer, and lastly the complexity of the actual work, all of which directly or indirectly had an effect in this case.
Complexity was also dealt with during Jacks working process. Specifically in this instance the complexity of the material. Jack asked the dancers to utilize counter directions in order to perform various exercises. In theory the use of counter directions sounds straight forward but in practice it can be problematic without a clear explanation. With this strong base in counter directions Jack then guided the dancers through an improvisation with changing body part focus. This section became very appealing to me as a viewer the moment that the dancers seemed excited and engaged by their task. It was during this creative high that Jack had cleverly introduced the paradox of making something serious and lighthearted in the same instance which he latterly explained as being one of his aims in his creative process.
I was reminded again of this exciting turn in the creative process when Jack asked “what from this last session would you consider worthy of putting on stage”.  For me this paradoxical moment was the part I as the observer would have chosen to put on stage but interestingly this was also the moment that the dancers pin pointed, which leads me on to the next subject, ‘the personal motivations of the dancers’. During our post first-phase discussion  we learned from Jack  that for him as a choreographer he likes to know which aspects of the work each dancer likes and why.  Most of the group were quite shocked by this admission however Jack went on to explain that for him, gaining this insight into his dancers mind is paramount in understanding how to maximize their potential within the frame of his work, once more we can recognise this as an issue of complexity.
After this inspiring discussion we continued on to the second-phase of Jacks time. At this point it was easy to see the positive effect this open discussion had on the group attitude. Jack began by asking the dancers to form two couples and one lone dancer. Within the couples each partner would directly and later indirectly give the other their own extremities whilst maintaining a constant audience directed focus, the lone dancer would execute the same task but use her imagination as her partner. At this point an organic cross pollination of ideas flowed between Jack and Gabriella.  For me this was the most inspiring part of the day and it was at this stage in the day when I first caught a glimpse of a symbiosis between theatricality and movement. Gabriella and Jack each noticed a crisis moment within the work, this crisis moment for Jack was anytime that the dancers took their focus from the audience. Jack proposed that this was due to a lack of audience acknowledgement and that at all times the dancers should direct their focus front. However for Gabriella this the moment of crisis was when the dancers gave too much focus to the audience and did not maintain an equal triangulation between themselves, their partner and the audience. 
We concluded the day with an example of Gabriella’s working process. Focus was an ingredient which Gabriella chose to highlight in her work though for her it manifested itself as the internal focus of the dancer. Gabriella gave a free reign with her improvisation but asked that the dancers keep in their minds eye the idea of exposure. Gabriella’s area of interest in this case was to see how the dancers deal with the concept of freedom combined with the directive of being constantly exposed. Again we see an example of complexity and the commonality between Jack and Gabriella here is that they were both interested in the psychology of the dancers though with differing motives. When clarifying her task to the dancers Gabriella asked that the dancers to have a busy mind but relaxed body, an echo of her warm-up, so that they would never allow their minds to pause. The terminology ‘pause’ was also used by Gabriella and then Jack earlier in the day to convey their desire to avoid a resting point for the body.
Terminology is an interesting area to pay attention to for both dancer and choreographer. Words are so multifunctional that it is very easy to misconstrue meaning.  This was something which we experienced at the very end of the day within Gabriella’s last improvisation task. The word ‘freedom’ compounded by the complexity of the task at hand and the complexity of the dancers proved to be problematic to process. 

My conclusion is to highlight the importance of complexity in any working process and the difficulty of  achieving a mental ‘state’ or ‘flow’ conducive to creativity in a limited period of time.
