##Gender on the Dance Floor : March 6 and 7

As part of the frame series, in which the danslab fellows open the research center to the dance world and the public beyond for special interest topics, research needs that extend beyond the personal practice, topics that the DL fellows find pertain to their history in the field and their dance community, Jack Gallagher hosted an intimate discussion group on the topic Gender on the Dance Floor. This research need has been with him for years, first as dancer and then as maker. And our Frame guests testified to the familiarity of the often subdued, hidden, often paradoxical, problematic of articulating content along the lines of gender, even when its always present. Cognative Psychologists say that Gender is the first thing to be “counted” to be percieved, in any extra or interpersonal encounter. It's the first thing we see about another person.  Always.

As dancers and makers we are always looking. Looking at and reading bodies. Reading action as behavior and behavior as action. So Gallagher went thru his personal reservoir of topics, issues and notions and asked the following work questions to the fellow explorers at the danslab:

Are we engaging in particular projects of change in gender relations already?  If so ...What?

Is it just a dramaturgy issue now or are we still subjected to dynamics in the process that expose preconceived modes based on or that trigger the infamous gender gap?

Where and when is the discussion for the orientation of gender on the dance floor?

Does any normalized preconceived backward conceptuality about gender still exist or did we solve the gender issues in dance creation and performance amongst ourselves already?
 
If we are in the business of constructing ourselves and exploring what a ‘making’ of the body might mean, don't we have an everyday practice of repositioning gender in a very significant way?

“As someone raised with a kind of armchair feminist Mother who taught me to see the behaviorisms which perpetuate the normative violence that is Gender in the shared social environment, it was surprising me, comfortably embedded in an open and liberal artistic community as I am, to hear all the variations of people being uncomfortable with the gender stereotypes, the “shoulds” and “should nots”  and hearing them testify as to how much that still plays a part in their artistic practice/daily life. Maybe some themes never go away!” - Jack Gallagher 

At the danslab, the small workgroup (20 or so) began each day by opening up an experimental discussion based on testimonials, confessions from the field and followed this up by stimulating activities, analysis, hypothetical definitions or just simply blurring the ones that seem to perpetuate themselves even in our liberal artistic community.

Gallagher started it off by asking everyone to be careful of ideology; we can solve everything in words 'right off the bat' and kill the discussion with platitudes. None of any one's notions expressed fit exactly with everyone, but that's why we gathered: To see and hear and feel the gaps that can be turned into a space for fun and adventure for the mind, for conceptuality, once the political positioning is suspended. This is the main facet of having a research facility- to temporarily suspend the political and professional positioning that all too often dominates public space: all those private ambitions and their maneuverings. We saved the “expertise” till the end, when our guests had had a chance to engage on their own terms. Diane Elshout, choreographer, dance scientist and dramaturge was able to assemble a new her dicertation material on dance and gender putting together a very informing and entertaining “terug blik”. From Pre-Freudian psuedo scientific back room stagings, studies and antics surrounding to the discovery of the new female disease “Hysteria” to Judith Butlers eloquent but tough demands to end the normative violence that strict gender coding does, to say the least, to the potency of the spirit. But more on that later.
  

Invited Speakers- Testimonials Robert Stein, Suzan Tunca, Arno Schuitemaker 

Three personal reflections on the working questions started the afternoon. Robert's many years in different positions in the field of dance allowed him to be very candid and he really set the stage for saying what was true to his experience.

“I am a theater maker: I can play anything I want to play. On stage, I'm another person....my ego is outside the door.” Robert Stein

Robert recounted that all the labels associated with being a man practicing a Gay lifestyle such as sissy etcetera “count” in in his art practice and as much in the process as in the stage result. They are not determinant, but contextual...this was something that appeared a lot in peoples stories. Arno Schuitemaker was “too male, too strong” for his Ballet teacher. Somehow the  artist's entré into the field already contains a lot of engendered factors; guide lines until you accomodate until you start to redefine them. Not identifying particularly with environments identifiable as belonging to power structures, Robert's practice takes him where women collegues are often in the drivers seat; leading a process, responsible for the production. In his practice, he finds the symbolic authority managed in ways entirely different to the typical male patriarchal power stucture and pre determined logical procedures. He even suggests there is an inherent difficulty particular to female choreographer's interests in subject content that needs to be accessed in order to make a section/piece 'work'. And this of course sets the stage for the choreographer to blame the dancer for not being stable or clear enough when it comes down to the wire around premiere time. Male choreographers seem to make structural the proceedings so as to eliminate this personal assesments of performers  and their content stability. As a result, Robert is busy with creating strategies for collaborations. His question in the studio to move beyond the gender issue- “What systems do you have for perceiving the world?”  From there the terms are defined anew. All is material for the theater play.

Suzan Tunca, former dancer with Krisztina de Chatel and now with Emio Grecco/Peter Scholten prepared a list of facinating polarities, which indicated a freedom to identify distinctions without accusations. Her confessed unproblematic childhood background and with the choreographers mentioned above, she's been allowed to investigate any and all aspects of polar opposites  normally attributed with gender. In work that seeks to transcend the biases and associations about what kind of body can do this or that, in choreography that puts males and females, straights and gays next to each other without any theatricalized distinctions, in a stage art that seeks to transcend gender identified expressions Suzan is putting body mind connectivity, cellular memory and synchronicity all as primarilty gender neutral are at the heart of the matter in her work. Clearly this allows her to explore freely the polarities and dualities that we all have in particular combination according to the work she is doing.

Interesting questions raised: How do we detach the sexual organs from the view? A lot of people found the Androgyny the most interesting, fascinating on stage. Erik Kaile's use of 'semiotic slippage'...where typical cornerstone definitions, signs and clues simply don't function any more according to engendered sterotypes. The beginning of our collective subversion of the  in terms of gender interests arrived with the question... Can gender be self identified? Certainly the group was unified on the idea that a binary opposition, attributed to sexation is a violence perpetrated to maintain a normalicy for convienience...but Diane Elshout offered at the end of the weekend the key question...”who is violating who and how?” which begs the question “what does it serve?”  The work group was clearly exhausted by the question natural vs. normalized, biological vs. cultural...since these binary oppositions are clearly attached to agendas which discount the individuals give right to create and perform their own narrative. 

A case in point:
Arno Schuitemaker, choreographer attested to a scenario that had the straight men all nodding in recognition. The story of a man attracted to dance but finding his masculine identity challenged by the aesthetics and teaching methods of a female classical ballet teacher. Couldn't I learn to dance like a man? Maybe I don't want to be feminized by Ballet? Aren't there movement qualities associated with sexation? But Schuitemaker finds it no longer a problem as maker. He chooses people to work with that can identify with his ideas, period. What are the meta programs (social and biological) that can determine the information processing of his collegues in a working relationship? Arno is able to cast his dancers according to what he wants to tell and finds that dance genres too often predict gender roles. He prefers personalities. Every new theme determines how he wants to tap the resources of the bodies he works with. How do the dancers follow my train of thought?

Arno's confession resonated with a general implication that authoritative impositions are passing away in most choreographic processes represented in our research group. But it didn't indicate that the “problem” of authority or leadership or final responsibility falls away. It merely gets personalized. Male and female choreographers might act typically different when it comes to handling the leadership of collaborations in todays field.

Robert Stein: How is it for instance, to be a male performer in a work of a female choreographer?  How easy is it for a man to be asked to be creative by a woman who is in the position to make the final decisions. I worked  with a woman who said she could only dance with me because there was no danger of sexual intimacy because I am gay.  And another women was questioning the masculinity of my way of moving, because I was not a real man. That sounds cruel, but a lot of choreographers unconsciously want to
stage their erotic ideals, and sometimes they have a strange idea about
what is masculine, men. 

##The female choreographer can get easily take the role of the mother who
plays that she is  sad and hurt because her child, the dancer isn’t  able
to  do the things she asked from him.

When the date of the premiere arrives the private fear about the question if the performance becomes a success can be projected on the shortcomings of the dancer. 

Gallagher's contribution at this point: 'In short, what sustains the difference between the two sexes is not the direct reference to a series of symbolic oppositions (masculine reason versus feminine emotion, masculine activity versus feminine passivity, etc.), but a different way of coping with a necessary inconsistency involved the act of assuming and the same universal symbolic feature (ultimately that of 'castration'). It is not that man stands for logos as opposed to be feminine emphasis on emotions; it is rather that, for man, logos as the consistent and coherent universal principle of all reality relies on the constitutive exception of some mystical, ineffable X ('there are things one should not talk about'), while, in the case of a woman, there is no exception, 'one can talk about everything', and, for that very reason, the universe of logos becomes inconsistent, in coherent, dispersed, 'non -- all'  Slavoj Zizek.

Diane Elshout “Gender is performative: there is a measurable discontinuity between anatomy and gender identity.” she invokes us to a non-historical before desire was differentiated by social structures. 

Sasha Steenks, free lance choreographer on the gender frame:
Terugdenkend aan gisteren vind ik onder anderen de thematiek die werd opgeworpen over fear or anxiety (two different things) interessant. Staat een man meer vanzelfsprekend in de wereld, heeft een vrouw toch meer het gevoel dat ze een plek moet veroveren, haar zijn moet bevestigen. Of verwachten anderen dit van haar?  Daarnaast blijft de thematiek van de honest body interessant. Zoals ik gisteren zei, zie ik het lichaam als gender als constructie niet als eerlijk, is er toch nog iets anders aan het lichaam dat misschien wel eerlijk is of is het lichaam nooit eerlijk? Is het lichaam altijd een constructie? Of een soort honest lies?  Er werd gisteren al gesproken over een biologisch en een cultureel lichaam, kan je dit onderscheid maken, zijn het niet verschillende aspecten van hetzelfde lichaam?  Wat houdt het woord body in?
