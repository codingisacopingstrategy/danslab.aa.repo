The codes and languages in the relationship between choreographers and dancers
Den Hague 2010
 
 
Hereby my reflections produced by the encounters …when I say this (‘hereby my reflections produced by the encounters’) it does not mean that I have produced thoughts. Certainly, I was witnessing (partly participating in) encounters of opinions. And it is what I found very empowering, the possibility of that to happen, however I am very curious how that (the last session) will turn into a thought…What will be the product of this encounters? Can it be proud of itself and able to walk on the dance field ? 
From my observations (summer) …
I have made a simplistic division at the very beginning in order to have a fair base for my thoughts. I have made my own encounter by saying: Lets equal language to a specificity of a choreographic idiom, like a specificity of a language that is governed by grammatical rules etc, and additionally lets equal the code to generally understood systems of rules that helps to produce or interpret signs (social codes).
 
Concluding, via my simplistic division. Gabriella is open to invite all possible and impossible propositions that would inform and transform her understanding of a code and even the language she uses, whereas Andrea does not question the understanding of the code but welcomes different personalities to interpret what she proposes as a language. 
 
A short conclusion…
Now, I will try to be very concise about where this encounters brought me. It goes like this: Language, partly, constitutes on construction of sense. This sense often falls into regimes of certain logic. Any logic is quite impossible because it possesses capacities for self-destruction, an encounter is a potential for that to happen. Different set of arguments plus different sets of arguments will end up in the possible conflict. To put this into rehearsal: an encounter between a choreographer and a chorographer or a dancer with a choreographer etc. --- each caring different set of ideas, expectations, desires, knowing and not knowing, translating knowledge and interpreting knowledge will not easily slide without resistance. The resistance is needed. The resistance is needed because it must create a positive ambiguity a kind of silence that will feed the process of re-thinking ones own assumptions. 
After questions I asked …
 
When I entered the sessions, I came with a topic zooming into a question: This observation will focus around the area of power relationship between a performer and a choreographer. My question is; what are the features of a relationship between a dancer and a choreographer when a strong, fixed code-language is at work?  What are the forms of agreement? After participating, and zooming into insights I ended up making more questions… The power relationships are always at work; there is no freedom as such, because things inherently condition us. Therefore, one should reflect upon such constructions of conditionings, and when such does exist--- how this function not in terms of craftiness but in terms of it’s structuring (what assumptions build this relationship etc.)… Can we talk why we make dance? Can we talk about what made us make the dance we make? Can we talk about why we dance? What those needs reflect? Do you have sense ethics when you think about your practice? 
At the end, I am quite triggered and curious what this encounters will bring in terms of alliances …
