Observations by Olivier van Nooten 






New exercise
 
Interest is not intention
Intense interaction still
In ten seconds all boundaries dissolve...
		           until


Vangen: ontvangen: ontvankelijk

Het lijkt of – nee het lijkt op
niets tenzij betekenis vereist is
ontkom ik niet aan invulling
wanneer mijn hoofd de lijn mist?

Zeg mezelf: het mag, het mag
te zien zonder begrijpen, als een
danser in verwarring plots stopt
en net als ik er bij zit
Crash along

Hear all bodies twist
and shout to overcome
gravity and time enough
for lines beyond beginning

(but not for long
on butt fur lung)

to an end means nothing 
less then just for now 
forgotten

rest your head 
to leave the neck 
only muscles 
move and sing

Ga op

Voeten voelen vloer ze
tasten nog te lopen paden af 
en aandacht langzaam langs
verzonken in gedachten of 
zonder plan boven de bodem.

In een hoek gekozen kijk ik toe
steeds bewuster van mijn houding
tot dansend over blad de inkt me 
meedogenloos in lijnen vergeet






Breaking the gaze

Eyes never leave the window
so how fragile is the audience
intended so transparent even
dialogue might go through
when suddenly the rules bend
and language unknown giggles


 “If you want it to happen, don’t say it”

en tussen regels door bewegen
woorden rond gelande dansers
grond heeft ze gevonden nu
ze zitten kijken horen spreken.

Frisse lucht daagt tevergeefs
de neergestreken wezens uit
toch toe te geven aan de tocht
gedoofd gedogen ze gebogen
History repeating

Connected to what happened
movements explore the next
past, then again dismantled
by the need to be progressive

how personal the skin and still
will untouched land be found
if eyes are clear enough not to 
look back in search of contrast




Uit de lamp

De richting laat zich raden
loopt uit de hand en voeten
nee verder nog, van top tot
teen of weer en heen of voor 
het eerst de geest is los gelaten
Paradox

Ze draaien om hun as
de rollen tot het onderste
verstrikt weer boven ligt
maar nu ontdaan van stof

knap lastig is te vangen
wat wil vliegen om te zijn
als de leden maten tekens 
niks te maken hebben met


Blisters

Frames on fire
heat their feet,
the need to feel
free from flames

enlightened by the
tired flesh in death
no generations lost
longing for fresh

The codes and languages in the relationship between choreographers and dancers
Den Hague 2010


Hereby my reflections produced by the encounters …when I say this (‘hereby my reflections produced by the encounters’) it does not mean that I have produced thoughts. Certainly, I was witnessing (partly participating in) encounters of opinions. And it is what I found very empowering, the possibility of that to happen, however I am very curious how that (the last session) will turn into a thought…What will be the product of this encounters? Can it be proud of itself and able to walk on the dance field ? 
From my observations (summer) …
I have made a simplistic division at the very beginning in order to have a fair base for my thoughts. I have made my own encounter by saying: Lets equal language to a specificity of a choreographic idiom, like a specificity of a language that is governed by grammatical rules etc, and additionally lets equal the code to generally understood systems of rules that helps to produce or interpret signs (social codes).
 
Concluding, via my simplistic division. Gabriella is open to invite all possible and impossible propositions that would inform and transform her understanding of a code and even the language she uses, whereas Andrea does not question the understanding of the code but welcomes different personalities to interpret what she proposes as a language. 
 
A short conclusion…
Now, I will try to be very concise about where this encounters brought me. It goes like this: Language, partly, constitutes on construction of sense. This sense often falls into regimes of certain logic. Any logic is quite impossible because it possesses capacities for self-destruction, an encounter is a potential for that to happen. Different set of arguments plus different sets of arguments will end up in the possible conflict. To put this into rehearsal: an encounter between a choreographer and a chorographer or a dancer with a choreographer etc. --- each caring different set of ideas, expectations, desires, knowing and not knowing, translating knowledge and interpreting knowledge will not easily slide without resistance. The resistance is needed. The resistance is needed because it must create a positive ambiguity a kind of silence that will feed the process of re-thinking ones own assumptions. 
After questions I asked …
 
When I entered the sessions, I came with a topic zooming into a question: This observation will focus around the area of power relationship between a performer and a choreographer. My question is; what are the features of a relationship between a dancer and a choreographer when a strong, fixed code-language is at work?  What are the forms of agreement? After participating, and zooming into insights I ended up making more questions… The power relationships are always at work; there is no freedom as such, because things inherently condition us. Therefore, one should reflect upon such constructions of conditionings, and when such does exist--- how this function not in terms of craftiness but in terms of it’s structuring (what assumptions build this relationship etc.)… Can we talk why we make dance? Can we talk about what made us make the dance we make? Can we talk about why we dance? What those needs reflect? Do you have sense ethics when you think about your practice? 
At the end, I am quite triggered and curious what this encounters will bring in terms of alliances …

##finding the ungraspable
My breathing reflect upon my space from inside
The sensation of thin and thick simultaneously in one part
Panic because of the unknown or do you know?  
Painful sand in your throat that echo’s on your skin with an itch. You become a baby.  
##The ultimate  {: style='background-color: white;' }
I want to tell you how much I love you…  
Its many nuances of red, including a tone of black which makes it dark; it moves slowly, the sound is time, the time is atmosphere, drops; its beyond the touch but it has something in common with it, cause you can’t see it, neither hear it, eat it ect… it is inside your organs but you can perceive it outside you, far away; but it comes towards you, slowly and yet inevitably – it is scary – but vital, it has to see with being alive, although you know one day you will be dead

##Emptiness  {: style='background-color: white;' }
The smell of a memory  
My intuition or my imagination as you wish….my feeling of thought

##DO YOU REMEMBER THE ASSIGNMENT?  {: style='font-size: xx-large; background-color: white;' }
**What do you don’t like on stage? We collect the messages, do not read them out loud, but let them perform by ourselves…. ** 
I don’t want to feel regret  
I don’t want to take part in a show which critics the others or manipulates the audience.  
I don’t like when they want me to feel emphatic their performance and moves of old fashioned messages  
I don’t want to see chairs on stage ( a banch is ok)  
I don’t want to be weak  
I don’t want to be used in a way that I am not allowed to ask questions  
I don’t want to see other peoples problems on stage  
I don’t like to be exposed or invented to see what we all already know; like: banal statements etc  
I don’t like to see metaphorical masturbations on stage; only the physical ones  
I don’t want to get injured  
I don’t want to get in social and psychological private problems with the people I am working with  
I don’t want to perform something which I do not believe in  
I don’t want to be seen as a table  
I don’t want to be bored  
I don’t like to be exposed or invited to see performances that rub in face  
I don’t want to be abuse by the choreographer – as a dancer  
I don’t like it when I am not able to join in  
I don’t like artists who talk about money more than once every two weeks  
I don’t want to be a slave to a concept  
I don’t want to just explore ego  
I don’t like wishy washy performances  
I don’t like arrogant ‘know it all’s’ on stage  
I don’t like artistic appropriation of social illness  
I don’t like to be invited or exposed to performances that are not conscious of its own product
