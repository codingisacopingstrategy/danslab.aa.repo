##1. Inner (self) action
Agitation.  Molecular Agitation.
Agitation inside-out-in, infinite movement (body, breath, voice), not in a continuous round/harmonic way or even consequential/coherent like a stream way (what happens in other works like Prayers, where there’s a flux of unconsciousness translated in a flux of sound and movement, or in kunikuli where the starting point of the physicality is based on Gabriella’s years of research work on continuity of the movement – so there’s another level introduced now, or a transformation of this previous concept ).
So recapping : infinite movement, not continuous and also as less repetitive as possible (so it’s not – only – about shaking ) but instead:  constant agitation, non stopping – self-regenerator –  recyclable movement, which let itself go to unanticipated, undecided places in the body.
Micro agitation, movement burning like fire, sometimes just latently in its inner-micro-events,  others in it’s out-bursting expression, well… alive(redundantly) through incessant activity in its (the body) negligible and infinite cells. 
– We’ve started with the focus on the impossible but challenging idea of simultaneous endless motion of every joint and bones (first by sections of the body: feet / legs and feet /torso/ arms /torso and arms/ torso, arms and head and all together) in all likely and unlikely combinations of its articulation. This lead us to a deeper level of agitation:  muscles, organs/viscera, breath, voice - all physical generators of chain-actions and reactions of energetic movement but also triggering mind activity (specially imagery – in this case where surprise and non-control get over logic and decision) and which also opens the door for emotional agitation…already there, eventually, but still to be explored – next phase, I guess).



##2. Inter (group) action
Agitation.Transmition.
Agitation inside-out and around - Here , directly or indirectly, we’ve worked, apart from our body, with the energy field around it – or the physic  layer of rarefied matter (the breath is a good example of it) which allows the perceptive “communication”  of bodies in a space. To make it more clear, a very simple analogy: like fishes in an aquarium which through the water matter, get all the information, not only visual but also in a wide sensorial way, they are all in the same water so every action has an effect on this matter that “transports” some kind of information that on its place can (or not) provoke a reaction on who receives it and so on. 
So, we started from the breathing exercise we were working in previous rehearsals (moving, letting go and dropping weight through the breath - as our self-base of movement) and then, in groups, we’ve tried to accumulate the idea of the energy field around us and in the space as the primary link of inter-action. This became sometimes a very ample and abstract concept , even subjective in our way of experiencing it .So, we arrived to the conclusion that it is very difficult to put it in practice, but,  despite on these difficulties, when sometimes we can grasp it and it is just there (which we know because we all feel/sense it and see it, both those who are inside and who is watching) there is something fascinating about it, something that inspire us in different dimensions, because, in my opinion or belief,  this experience becomes within us, we can live it’s dynamic qualities,  whether you are passively or actively participating in it.
What is it exactly that makes it work and how to get there… this is what we are searching for. 

Connected to the idea of agitation and sensorial/perceptive/”energetic” awareness, Gabriella wanted to work with group structures and strategies that leads to, let’s say, alternative ways of group connection and inter-action ,in improvisation, but also in “transmitting and getting material”, searching new approaches to unisons and movement phrases (with the wish of escaping namely from set material – even if we also work on it -  coping processes, and untimely, improvisation structures as instant composition).
With the aim that is described above and having the work of breath and weight as a base, we’ve worked in the following concepts applied to group movement research:
Molecular agitation, infinite body/spatial/sound vibration, propagation, repercussion, contamination, contagion, transmission, resonance, 
derivation, association. Other inputs and ways of presence on group 
relations were also explored: Expansion of the movement/breath/voice/noise, open – outwards  awareness, multiplied visual and sound impressions, expanded images, epidemic impulses and sensations, extensive stimulations, spread pulsation, merging incorporated intuitions; capacity of following, joining and being with; shared places, amalgamation, tuned breath, communal language*, collective voice, amplified statements, urban (primitive) spirit, mass initiative, manifestation, public space.

(Note: another urban movement which can also be inspiring in the context of group structures experiments: Flashmob - consists in a large group of people who assemble suddenly in a public place, perform an unusual action for a brief time, then quickly disperse). 


##3. Outer – action
Agitation. Manifest Agitation.
Invading space, time and sound, opening out penetratingly (awareness, attitude, look, body, voice), long-drawn-out body parts knife-like; pointing out finger, showing the finger, finger in the wound ; shoot out breaths and spit  guts; voice, noise, musicality of the movement; throwing everything (physical, mental, emotional, willing pieces of us), throwing metaphorical stones, body as an object, rapping boundaries, piercing surroundings and beyond, stabbing the space, cutting borders, breaking walls (forth wall); free -straight -forward - careless attitude, assertiveness,  clear- headed directions, acute determination, sharp intention, efficient action, striking messages, harsh speech, spoken words, dirty words, refined vomiting, purge act, activism - guerrilla tactics (attacking vulnerable targets in enemy territory – in analogy with  attacking dance community , while audience,   in the Theater) - destruction, ground zero, reconstruction,  non-violent Direct Action - squatting place and right of expression, of existence; free thought and spirit, right of  indignation, rebellion, awakening consciousness, courageous social action of accusation, acid piece against, Target:  YOU(audience)– dance community. 

Although these ideas could bring a sense of primitive and raw confrontational attitude, what Gabriella searches in this outer-action is also a certain elegancy aspect that somehow she / we recognize as belonging to the acidity of this piece.
In the outer–action level, the spoken words and text take predominance, given that they are a mean of direct communication. The voice and text are to be explored in various ways, some of them lead to urban and politic movements (somehow all embodying  punk and hip-hop ideologies)  like spoken word: Rap, beat box, street protesting Poets and Poetry Slams, Wall writing, Graffiti and Slogans.
 – Gabriella expressed her will of keeping the focus on the core of the message which should be very direct, simple and fuelled of “cold roughness” – so these verbal manifestos named above are examples of this essential, straight –forward way of communication, without extras or adorns. In this sense Gabriella is more inclined to aphorism and efficiency Vs. pulp and intricate lines of thoughts and messages, but all directions of approaching the text are to be explored in this phase. So, more intellectual and complex ways of passing a message were also considered to the research process, for example tactics like: Meme Hack and Subvertising or Culture Jamming, which involved a more erudite, ironic and articulated games of linguistic and use of image. Anyhow the general idea is to have messages in a “slogan – punch” format.  

It was very interesting to try to apply these same principles and ideas, to the movement material (which the base physicality, once again, is agitation, the use of breath and weight work). We’ve worked on movement phrasing (the musicality of the movement, its sound, noises, silences, punctuation, intonation, and accents), involving the concepts of slogan, efficiency, clarity (among others mentioned above). This phrasing and its incorporated concepts were embodied trough improvised movement which does not mean less clarity of the specific language that was “speaking” –we’ve searched for the same principle of clearness of written words.
More and more, Gabriella is getting fascinated with the powerful impact of the written word as well as its graphic effect - which also opens the chapter of scenography (the visual artist Jenny Holzer is an inspiring reference for this subject both for visual and content of the messages– but the scenography subject is to be considered in a more advanced phase of the research process).
For me, this particular section of group work became one of the most rich and consistent part of our research until now.
