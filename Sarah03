‘The performing body as Luther’s printing press: holy, heretical, heterodox. Killing us softly with its song.’

‘The director is a midwife, sharing wisdom and experience; giving context, proposing a mode of discourse. Call her Ishmael.’

‘Every performance centres around the observer. Not simply to watch, but to make sense of it.’

‘Performance offers no answers, but it deepens the questions.’

[intro]
‘The beauty of open-ended inquiry as opposed to pre-production research is that it keeps resurfacing in unexpected moments.’ Teaching a workshop in West Africa in May 2010, choreographer Erik Kaiel found himself building further upon the Danslab research he did in February of this same year. ‘Inshallah.’

Nagadef. Relentless sun, bleating goats, mantras from the mosques. In shade wreathed in birdsong I sit to write. A paradoxical peace, as these intricate rhythms interlace. I am now in Saint Louis, Senegal’s colonial capital. Two flights and a winding road have brought me here. Dusty towns, Baobab forests, and scrub brush deserts give way to a litany of white buses passing through. Al-Hamdulilla-Hi painted across the front of each as a spiritual front bumper good luck charm. I find myself in a nation of black cranes, long, elegant, gracious, graceful, demure. Even the taxi drivers have the patience of saints. 
I have come to teach, to offer contemporary forms to young dancers brought up on hip-hop and traditional Senegalese dance. Somehow, between tribal elders and MTV, I need to carve out a third space; not another fixed form, but an openness for each individual voice. Private language in public space. The performing body as Luther’s printing press: holy, heretical, heterodox. Killing us softly with its song. I am encouraging each performer to forge an alloy of indigenous forms, Western practice, and personal approach. False lions and carnivorous lambs. A discipline without disciples. Al-Hamdulilla-Hi. Bedouin intent. Cacophonic order. Paradoxical peace. Beauty is the road self-chosen, not blindly followed. 

[tussenkop] Utopia
For some, form follows function. For me, intent is the content. Satyagraha as the Holy Grail. The rest are overtones. The performer commits their entire being to their intention. Submission to the will of the action. Through this they are fully alive. They model an intensity of being unsustainable in everyday life. When asked why he wrote poetry, Pessoa responded: ‘Because life is not enough’. The performer does the same. 
I share this priority of absolute commitment with Grotowski, but my liberation theology goes a step further. That commitment must not be towards the intent of the director, but to the performer’s own intent. ‘Do it like you mean it.’ The unintended gesture has no worth. The unlived life is not worth examining. 
To achieve this, both producer and director must sacrifice their authority -including the myth of individual authorship- to the practitioners. The director is a midwife, sharing wisdom and experience; giving context, proposing a mode of discourse. Call her Ishmael. On the beach, helping to launch a living theatre, where performance is not a fixed form, but a shared understanding between performers; a constantly-adapting organism; an elusive utopian whale. 
To achieve this goal, every performer must build their technical skills and heighten their awareness. Every performer is both rudder and oar. Within the creation process and occasionally in performance as well, anyone can propose a direction. However, unless the others freely choose to row in that direction, there is no movement. Only a litany of propositions. 

[tussenkop] Après-Lazarus
Stanislavski has his magic ‘if’, but I find it too conjectural, too weak. It accepts the world as it is. Like much of contemporary life, it wallows in simplified narration, overemphasizing the theoretical and ignoring the conscience. The Conscience, treated as a leper, has become Lazarus. Wrapped up, written off, buried and left for dead. Conscience is a broken-down lawnmower; it is the unexamined life gathering dust in the corner of the garage. Performance, in its active examination of life-as-it-is-being-lived, re-ignites that engine, bringing it back to life. Offering a model for thoughtfulness, intentionality. Performance offers no answers, but it deepens the questions. That is its après-Lazarus role. 

Too much contemporary performance has been paralysed by cultural relativity. If everything is possible, then nothing matters. Nothing is meant, nothing remains but a chain of Calder mobiles afloat in the theoretical air, utterly divorced from life, proclaiming their cleverness and their absolute inefficacy in the same sotto voce. 
It is not enough. There are only two crucial questions, for the director, for the performer and for the public: ‘What must be?’ and ‘Why?’ Each of us answers differently, and that is the point. The answer is never the same two consecutive days in a row and that is the point. In asking these questions anew each day, we heighten our sensitivity and deepen both our curiosity and our ability to respond in language, in movement and in life. The unexamined life is not worth living. The unlived life is not worth examining.

[tussenkop] Holy Grail
Every creation process centres around the performer. Through a dialogue with the material, the other performers and the director; the performer builds the highest possible degree of self-aware intention. Not in service to the director, but in service to the performer’s truth. Satyagraha as the Holy Grail. ‘Mean it when you do it’. Performance as the Agora. Private language in public space. Intricate rhythms interlacing. Bakhtinian harmonies arising from the cacophonic order. Authenticity arises, and the distinction between observers and practitioners blurs. Every performance centres around the observer. Not simply to watch, but to make sense of it.
The conceptual is one channel of performative communication, but not even the first among equals. Performance is not about, performance is. Full stop. There are emotive, physical, energetic, conceptual levels. The list goes on. The artist’s voice has overtones. Reading the work requires active viewing. Absorbing sensation on all these levels, each observer must make their own hierarchy of these levels within the work. Asking ‘what must be’ and ‘why’. Not only with the head, but with the entire body, all at once. 
Performative work truly exists in two places: at the level of physical reality, that is: the doing by the performers, and in the active viewing by the observers. The observers immerse themselves in the reverie of the work, and then each conjures forth a reverie of one’s own. Le recherché a la reverie perdu. Wherever two or more gather and their reverie’s overlap, that is reality. In all its gloriously messy revolutionary splendour. 

[tussenkop] Revolution
Viva la revolution! Every performer is a revolutionary. Revolving things so that they can be seen from new angles. The more successful performer-revolutionaries find a way to embody Kant’s categorical imperative, acting so that the maxims of their symbolic actions were to encourage universal reflection. I am not proposing an activist theatre in service of a particular ideology. The role of performance is not to promote a specific truth, but to highlight the world-that-is, the world-that-could-be, and the space between. Performance as the Agora. Bakhtinian heteroglossia, a multiplicity of voices within the work. Multiple perspectives, multiple potential interpretations. There is no right nor wrong, only a lot left to discuss. Private language in public space. The performing body as Luther’s printing press. Holy, heretical, heterodox. Killing us softly with its song.

[kop] Speech Act Theory
[subkop] Performing the Perlocutionary Act

[intro]
Jack Gallagher, under the auspices of Danslab, has taken it upon himself to approach movement as text. Using various models of linguistic analysis he has begun to correlate the act of dancing with speech, leading him towards a unique method of choreography. The following is a report of his findings and his work process to date.

[tekst]
I came to Danslab with a great desire to get down to specifics, namely: to work towards explicit conclusions about my creative vision, to decide upon how they could be applied, to map trajectories and most importantly, to design and carry out experiments. However, engaging in Practice as Research entails a necessary acceptance of the consequences of the output; a degree of intellectual and creative flexibility in the face of unexpected results.
 After all, if we knew all the answers, it wouldn't be research.

With my extensive background on stage and my involvement in experimental projects for more than two decades, I found myself in possession of ample and diverse preoccupations which could be ‘thrown onto the table’ on my first day in the studio. This is why I chose to work with only one dancer, which proved to be essential in view of the diversity and complexity of the ideas to be tested. The dancer needed to be capable of adjusting and modulating not only his body but also his intellectual assumptions.
My research hinged upon learning a new language for the creative process between myself and a dancer. I sought a different mode of output due to the fact that the conventional approaches towards movement no longer interested me given our contemporary state of performance-based conceptualism. Therefore, in order to gain a different form of output I was confronted with the need to devise a new manner of input.
I began by acquiring a knowledge base spanning various disciplines which challenged my innate capacities: my movement technique, my belief in movement as the essential element in dance performance and furthermore my desire to ‘create’ a specific dancer for my productions.

[tussenkop] Speech Act Theory
Speech acts form a part of semantic analysis within the field of linguistics. Speech Act Theory (henceforth referred to as SAT) seeks to analyse and categorize what kind of act is associated with the utterance or speaking of a certain type of sentence.
There are three basic speech acts: The locutionary act, The illocutionary act and The perlocutionary act. 
The first corresponds to the utterance of a sentence with a particular meaning. The second reflects the intent of the speaker in uttering the sentence i.e. to praise or to criticize for example. The third, finally, involves the effect that the speaker has on his or her addressees in uttering the sentence.
Consider the following example: a teacher is having difficulty maintaining order in the classroom; given the chaotic situation she utters the following sentence: “I’ll keep you in after class”. In uttering such a sentence, the teacher has simultaneously produced three speech acts: locutionary (the sentence includes an utterance with the explicit meaning that she will force the students to stay in school later than usual), illocutionary (a warning), and perlocutionary (silencing the students.).

The use of SAT as a mode of analysis is far from perfect, in fact in many cases a simple illocutionary act of warning could involve either a statement, a command, a yes-no question or even a what-why question. There is no definite one-to-one relationship between the structure of a sentence and speech acts. Despite this indirect relationship there are a small set of verbs whose use makes explicit the illocutionary force of a sentence: promise, bet, warn and agree for example. Such verbs are called Performatives, since the very act of producing them involves the performance of an illocutionary act: “I promise I’ll be there” – by saying this I have automatically carried out an illocutionary act of promising.

Hypothesis: Movement can replace speech in the Speech Act Theory in order to produce new choreographic material out of new movement performatives.

My hypothesis has the tendency to confuse those who try to come to grips with my research, assuming that I might be in search of some way of speaking with the body – as in some type of mime -or attempt to manufacture a ‘substitute’ language based on dance. Both these assumptions would be absurd. The SAT makes it clear that its method of analysis is only applicable to members of a language community; in this case, dancers and choreographers.
It must be noted however that the dance community at large seems to be wary of theoretical discussion and self reference. Where performance art and theatre have managed to find a semiotic interface within the shared communal cultural contents, a majority of dance productions continue to pursue an abstract and almost holy modernist agenda, obliviously celebrating a grotesque and elitist reduction. Nonetheless, the acquisition of virtuosic body control and an aesthetic metaphor remain crowning achievements. 

I turned to the SAT for the benefit of evoking our post-twentieth-century condition. The twenty-first century forces us to accept the fact that non-verbal communication accounts for eighty to ninety percent of our intercourse which emerges from a body whose sub-conscious can be likened to the structure of language. Furthermore, ‘image based culture’ or semiotic communication is replacing the dominant position that the written and spoken word used to occupy – video footage being shown as evidence in court rooms is just one example of the ascendancy of the image. Furthermore, the World Wide Web has contributed to a dissemination of power, decentralizing the agency of control, empowering the individual whilst constructing a vast labyrinth of selves and representations. Performatives take the place of ideals in such a culture. Finally concepts such as ‘fluidity’ and ‘responsibility’ are being interpreted through action – conflated by a trend where words and language have become more self referential and self conscious – leading to a consciousness of language that is being listened to for its ‘performative effect’.
All these factors contribute to my vision of a dancer who no longer denies his or her ‘linguistic facility’ but views it as an integral and structural part of his or her body.
I focused my attention on SAT in order to discover the means by which I could tap the resources of this linguistic facility that dancers are denying fetishistically.

The most challenging thing about artistic practice as research is to allow the results of your research to affect your artistic practice 
Adrian Heathfield, cultural theorist and Professor of Performance and Visual Culture at Roehampton University

My emphasis for the duration of the research was placed upon the documentation of my theoretical starting point, the experiments and the eventual results; striving to maintain a continuous transparency in view of unexpected results and potential conclusions. I had to construct a way to test certain key assumptions; the greatest challenge being a means of collecting resultant data.
Using the SAT, I mapped the three primary functions of speech I previously referred to: locutionary, illocutionary and perlocutionary. In collaboration with the dancer Matthew Roman I created a contemporary and variable dance phrase. From the index provided by the SAT, I then proceeded to organize the material into forty testing units, called ‘text boxes’, given the fact that we were considering movement as a text. We deconstructed the so called ‘meaning’ of the original nine minute phrase material, according to the SAT.
All in all, we found over 25 terms for ‘meaning’ that were more explicit and more intertwined with action. Terms such as convey, imply, render etc.
I considered this expansion of our vocabulary as the first breakthrough. It was a distinct departure from the willingness of the dance community to settle for the word meaning as a facile generalization to describe dance’s artistic endeavours.
I then proceeded to test the forty text boxes according to the different categories of illocutionary speech acts: 

Constative: expressive in nature, wherein a completed action can be judged either true or false.
Directive: used to indicate or guide. It includes any form of communication which initiates or governs action, conduct, or procedure
Comissive: commits a speaker to some future action; a promise or an oath for example.
Acknowledgement: expresses the speaker's attitudes and emotions towards a proposition. 

Illocutionary acknowledgements play an important role in complex conversation where initiative and intent are unstable. They serve to assure those engaged in the conversation that the dialogue retains order. Thus taking all this in account we found four versions of forty phrases which provided us with 160 examples of movement ‘utterances’. In fact it was the very word ‘utterance’ (To declare, bring forth or demonstrate, OED) and its conceptual nuance that allowed use to treat movement like speech. This realization amounted to our second breakthrough. Finally, Matthew Roman and I found the crucial missing link as to how speech functions: The Four Maxims.
When we engage in conversation or speech interaction we all abide by an unwritten rule which linguists call The Cooperative Principle; this refers to our contribution to the conversation and the correct manner of doing so. In order to ensure that our interactions comply with the cooperative principle a set of specific maxims have been developed: the maxim of relation (be relevant), the maxim of quality (make contributions that are true), the maxim of quantity (do not make contributions that are more or less informative than required) and finally the maxim of manner (avoid ambiguity, be brief and orderly). 
Paul Grice, a philosopher of language, informed much of my work; it was he who insisted that further distinctions and nuances be formulated within these maxims, nuances which we used to expand our experiments. The maxims refer to an ideal conversation and do not reflect how we speak on a daily basis; however, unconsciously we do judge our conversations by them. The maxims are how we listen, thus I will apply them in my future research involving audiences.

At this point the SAT makes a claim that I feel can be imported directly into dance performance, and which will be refreshing and innovative for all dance audiences:
The assumption that one is being truthful, relevant, quantitatively informational and appropriate is essential in the exchange of any content. Any deviation from these Maxims is how the meaning takes place. ‘Deviance’ is therefore the 'technique' of self-expression. Otherwise we would all speak like textbooks. Deviance from the norm is where personality begins to emerge. 
My third breakthrough occurred when I realized that my artistic work concerning the body in a world of robotic perfection and plastic surgery was greatly enhanced by a realization that imperfection is critical to the individuality of the self. When we tested the maxims on twenty students during a weekend workshop, I witnessed a distinct shift in the creative atmosphere. In fact I saw that these young, not fully trained dancers began inflecting their movements as a result of the utterance.
It became apparent after this workshop that the use and effect of SAT on a professional dancer such as Matthew Roman was enormous, particularly in regards to his style and technique. So enormous in fact that I started to see things unfamiliar to my choreographer's eye. The trials produced material that shifted beyond the usual boundaries. But instead of being an unrecognizable incoherent aberration they became another modality. It presented another approach to endowing choreographic material to the body, both consciously and sub-consciously.

The research presentation in December 2009 was an opportunity for me to substantiate my hypothesis, my suppositions and my methodology. With the amount theoretical ground still yet to cover (substantiated and supported by research assistant Diane Elshout) and the amount of data collection (assisted by Dramaturge Jochem Naafs), I anticipate that the organization, classification and analysis of my results (which will ultimately assess the success or failure of my choreographic method) will be a daunting task. Therefore in the second Danslab research phase I will be exploring a methodology called triangulation. Triangulation involves the application and combination of several research methodologies in the study of the same phenomenon. It can be employed in both quantitative (validation) and qualitative (inquiry) studies. Triangulation is the preferred line of analyses in the social sciences, applicable to art practice.
Once again Danslab has proved itself to be the place where you begin by pursuing what you want to do, and end up doing what you need to do. 
In research, one is constantly discovering new needs along the way.
